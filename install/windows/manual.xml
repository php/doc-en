     After the php package content has been extracted, copy the <filename>php.ini-production</filename> into <filename>php.ini</filename>
     in the same folder. If necessary, it is also possible to place the <filename>php.ini</filename> into any other location of your choice 
     but that will require additional configuration steps as described in <link linkend="configuration.file">PHP Configuration</link>.
     </para>
     <para>
      The <filename>php.ini</filename> file tells PHP how to configure itself, and how to work with the 
      environment that it runs in. Here are a number of settings for the <filename>php.ini</filename> file 
      that help PHP work better with Windows. Some of these are optional. There are 
      many other directives that may be relevant to your environment - refer to the 
      <link linkend="ini.list">list of php.ini directives</link> for more information.

     <para>
      Required directives:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>extension_dir</varname> = <literal>&lt;path to extension directory&gt;</literal> - The <varname>extension_dir</varname> needs 
         to point to the directory where PHP extensions files are stored. The path can be absolute 
         (i.e. &quot;C:\PHP\ext&quot;) or relative (i.e. &quot;.\ext&quot;). Extensions that are listed lower in the <filename>php.ini</filename> file need 
         to be located in the <varname>extension_dir</varname>.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>extension</varname> = <literal>xxxxx.dll</literal> - For each extension you wish to enable, you need a corresponding &quot;extension=&quot; 
         directive that tells PHP which extensions in the <varname>extension_dir</varname> to load at startup time.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>log_errors</varname> = <literal>On</literal> - PHP has an error logging facility that can be used to send errors to a file, 
         or to a service (i.e. syslog) and works in conjunction with the <varname>error_log</varname> directive below. When running under IIS, 
         the <varname>log_errors</varname> should be enabled, with a valid <varname>error_log</varname>.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>error_log</varname> = <literal>&lt;path to the error log file&gt;</literal> - The error_log needs to specify the absolute, 
         or relative path to the file where PHP errors should be logged. This file needs to be writable for the web server. 
         The most common places for this file are in various TEMP directories, for example &quot;C:\inetpub\temp\php-errors.log&quot;.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>cgi.force_redirect</varname> = <literal>0</literal> - This directive is required for running under IIS. 
         It is a directory security facility required by many other web servers. However, enabling it under IIS will 
         cause the PHP engine to fail on Windows. 
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>cgi.fix_pathinfo</varname> = <literal>1</literal> - This lets PHP access real path info following the CGI Spec. 
         The IIS FastCGI implementation needs this set.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>fastcgi.impersonate</varname> = <literal>1</literal> - FastCGI under IIS supports the ability to impersonate 
         security tokens of the calling client. This allows IIS to define the security context that the request runs under.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>fastcgi.logging</varname> = <literal>0</literal> - FastCGI logging should be disabled on IIS. If it is left enabled, 
         then any messages of any class are treated by FastCGI as error conditions which will cause IIS to generate an HTTP 500 exception.

      Optional directives
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>max_execution_time</varname> = <literal>##</literal> - This directive tells PHP the maximum amount of time that it can spend 
         executing any given script. The default for this is 30 seconds. Increase the value of this directive if PHP application take long time to execute.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>memory_limit</varname> = <literal>###M</literal> - The amount of memory available for the PHP process, in Megabytes. 
         The default is 128, which is fine for most PHP applications. Some of the more complex ones might need more.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>display_errors</varname> = <literal>Off</literal> - This directive tells PHP whether to include any error messages in the 
         stream that it returns to the Web server. If this is set to &quot;On&quot;, then PHP will send whichever classes of errors 
         that you define with the <varname>error_reporting</varname> directive back to web server as part of the error stream. 
         For security reasons it is recommended to set it to &quot;Off&quot; on production servers in order not to reveal any 
         security sensitive information that is often included in the error messages.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         <varname>open_basedir</varname> = <literal>&lt;paths to directories, separated by semicolon&gt;</literal>, e.g. 
         openbasedir=&quot;C:\inetpub\wwwroot;C:\inetpub\temp&quot;. This directive specified the directory paths where PHP 
         is allowed to perform file system operations. Any file operation outside of the specified paths will result in an error. 
         This directive is especially useful for locking down the PHP installation in shared hosting environments to prevent 
         PHP scripts from accessing any files outside of the web site's root directory.
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
         <para>
          <varname>upload_max_filesize</varname> = <literal>###M</literal> and <varname>post_max_size</varname> = <literal>###M</literal> - 
          The maximum allowed size of an uploaded file and post data respectively. The values of these directives should be 
          increased if PHP applications need to perform large uploads, such as for example photos or video files.
         </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
     </para>

     PHP is now setup on your system.  The next step is to choose a web
     server, and enable it to run PHP.  Choose a web server from the table of 
     contents.
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition to running PHP via a web server, PHP can run from the command
     line just like a <literal>.BAT</literal> script. See

     Windows</link> for further details.
