     This section contains notes and hints specific to Apache 2.x installs
     of PHP on Microsoft Windows systems. We also

     for Apache 1.3.x users on a separate page</link>.

     <title>Apache 2.2 Support</title>
     <para>
      Users of Apache 2.2 should note that the DLL file for Apache 2.2 is
      named <filename>php5apache2_2.dll</filename> rather than <filename>php5apache2.dll</filename>
      and is available only for PHP 5.2.0 and later.

    <para>
     You are strongly encouraged to consult the
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</link> to get
     a basic understanding of the Apache 2.x Server. Also consider
     reading the <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.windows;">Windows specific
     notes</link> for Apache 2.x before reading on here.
    </para>
    
     <para>
      Apache 2.x is designed to run on the Windows version designated as
      server platforms, such as Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000,
      Windows XP, or Windows 7. While Apache 2.x works tolerably well on Windows 9x,
      support on these platforms is incomplete, and some things will not work
      correctly. There is no plan to remedy this situation.
     </para>

    <para>
     Download the most recent version of <link xlink:href= "&url.apache;">
     Apache 2.x</link> and a fitting PHP version.
     Follow the <link linkend="install.windows.manual">Manual Installation
     Steps</link> and come back to go on with the integration of PHP and Apache.
    </para>

    <para>
     There are three ways to set up PHP to work with Apache 2.x on Windows.
     You can run PHP as a handler, as a CGI, or under FastCGI.

     <title>Installing as an Apache handler</title>
     <para>
      You need to insert the following lines into your
      Apache &httpd.conf; configuration file to load the
      PHP module for Apache 2.x:
      <example>
       <title>PHP and Apache 2.x as handler</title>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
# 
LoadModule php5_module "c:/php/php5apache2.dll"
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .php

# configure the path to php.ini
PHPIniDir "C:/php"
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>
     </para>
     <note>
      <simpara>
       Remember to substitute your actual path to PHP for the
       <filename>C:/php/</filename> in the above examples. Take care to use
       either <filename>php5apache2.dll</filename> or 
       <filename>php5apache2_2.dll</filename> in your LoadModule directive and
       verify that the referenced file is in fact located at the file path
       that you point to in this directive.
      </simpara>
     </note>
      <para>
      The above configuration will enable PHP handling of any file that has a
      .php extension, even if there are other file extensions. For example, a
      file named <filename>example.php.txt</filename> will be executed by the
      PHP handler. To ensure that only files that <emphasis>end in</emphasis>
      <filename>.php</filename> are executed, use the following configuration
      instead:
      </para>

      <example>

<![CDATA[
 <FilesMatch \.php$>

     <title>Running PHP as CGI</title>

     <para>
      You should consult the <link xlink:href="&url.apache.cgi;">Apache CGI
      documentation</link> for a more complete understanding of running CGI
      on Apache.
     </para>
   
     <para>
      To run PHP as CGI, you'll need to place your php-cgi files in a
      directory designated as a CGI directory using the ScriptAlias directive.
     </para>

     <para>
      You will then need to insert a #! line in the PHP files, pointing to the
      location of your PHP binary:

      <example>
       <title>PHP and Apache 2.x as CGI</title>
        <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
#!C:/php/php.exe
<?php
  phpinfo();
?>
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>
     </para>
     &warn.install.cgi;
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="install.windows.apache2.fastcgi">
     <title>Running PHP under FastCGI</title>

     <para>
     Running PHP under FastCGI has a number of advantages over running it as a
     CGI. Setting it up this way is fairly straightforward:
     </para>
     <para>
     Obtain mod_fcgid from 
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache.fcgid;">&url.apache.fcgid;</link>. Win32
     binaries are available for download from that site. Install the module
     according to the instructions that will come with it.
     </para>
     <para>
     Configure your web server as shown below, taking care to adjust any paths
     to reflect your how you have installed things on your particular system:

     <example>
     <title>Configure Apache to run PHP as FastCGI</title>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
LoadModule fcgid_module modules/mod_fcgid.so  

# Where is your php.ini file?
FcgidInitialEnv PHPRC        "c:/php" 

AddHandler fcgid-script .php  
FcgidWrapper "c:/php/php-cgi.exe" .php  
]]>
     </programlisting>
     </example>

     Files with a .php extension will now be executed by the PHP FastCGI
     wrapper.
