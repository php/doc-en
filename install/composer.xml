  <title>Introduction to Composer</title>

   &link.composer; is a dependency manager for PHP that makes it possible
   to define third-party packages of code that your project uses that can
   then be easily installed and updated. It leverages the the built-in
   <link linkend="language.oop5.autoload">class autoloading features</link>
   of PHP, repositories of PHP packages such as
   <link xlink:href="&url.packagist;">Packagist</link>, and common project
   layout and coding conventions.

   For example, if you are writing a PHP application or website that needs
   to work with <abbrev>UUID</abbrev> values, you might want to use
   <link xlink:href="&url.packagist.package;ramsey/uuid">Ben Ramsey's
   <literal>ramsey/uuid</literal> package</link> that implements the
   widely known and used types of UUIDs that are defined by
   <link xlink:href="&url.rfc;4122">RFC 4122</link>.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Briefly, you would do this by creating a <literal>composer.json</literal>
   in your project, using Composer to install the latest version of the
   package, and including Composer's autoload script to make it available
   to your code. The <link xlink:href="&url.composer;/doc/01-basic-usage.md">Composer
   "Basic Usage" documentation</link> goes into this in more depth.
