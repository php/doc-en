    <title>Apache 2.x on Unix systems</title>
    <para>
     This section contains notes and hints specific to Apache 2.x installs
     of PHP on Unix systems.

    <para>
     The <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</link> 
     is the most authoritative source of information on the Apache 2.x server.
     More information about installation options for Apache may be found
     there.
    </para>

    <para>
     The most recent version of Apache HTTP Server may be obtained from
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache;">Apache download site</link>,
     and a fitting PHP version from the above mentioned places.
     This quick guide covers only the basics to get started with Apache 2.x
     and PHP. For more information read the
     <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.docs;">Apache Documentation</link>.
     The version numbers have been omitted here, to ensure the
     instructions are not incorrect. In the examples below, 'NN' should be
     replaced with the specific version of Apache being used.
    </para>

    <para>
     There are currently two versions of Apache 2.x - there's 2.0 and 2.2.
     While there are various reasons for choosing each, 2.2 is the current
     latest version, and the one that is recommended, if that option is
     available to you. However, the instructions here will work for either
     2.0 or 2.2.
    </para>

     <orderedlist>
     <listitem>
     <para>Obtain the Apache HTTP server from the location listed above,
     and unpack it:</para>

     <example>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
gzip -d httpd-2_x_NN.tar.gz
tar -xf httpd-2_x_NN.tar
]]>
     </screen>
     </example>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
     <para>Likewise, obtain and unpack the PHP source:</para>

     <example>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
gunzip php-NN.tar.gz
tar -xf php-NN.tar
]]>
     </screen>
     </example>

     <listitem>
     <para>
     Build and install Apache. Consult the Apache install documentation for
     more details on building Apache.
     </para>

     <example>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
cd httpd-2_x_NN
./configure --enable-so
make
make install
]]>
     </screen>
     </example>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
 <para>
    Now you have Apache 2.x.NN available under /usr/local/apache2,
    configured with loadable module support and the standard MPM prefork.
    To test the installation use your normal procedure for starting
    the Apache server, e.g.:

    <example>
    <screen>
<![CDATA[
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
]]>
    </screen>
    </example>

    and stop the server to go on with the configuration for PHP:

    <example>
    <screen>
<![CDATA[
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop
]]>
    </screen>
    </example>
 </para>
 </listitem>

 <listitem>

<para>
Now, configure and build PHP.  This is where you customize PHP
with various options, like which extensions will be enabled. Run
./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
we'll do a simple configure with Apache 2 and MySQL support. 
</para>

<para>
If you built Apache from source, as described above, the below example will
match your path for apxs, but if you installed Apache some other way, you'll
need to adjust the path to apxs accordingly. Note that some distros may rename
apxs to apxs2.
 </para>
     <example>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
cd ../php-NN
./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql
make
make install
]]>
      </screen>
     </example>

     <para>
    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you'll need to re-run the configure, make, and make install steps. 
    You only need to
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.
    </para>
         
    <para>
    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.
    </para>

    </listitem>

  <listitem>
  <para>
  Setup your php.ini 
  </para>
    
     <example>
     <screen>
<![CDATA[
cp php.ini-development /usr/local/lib/php.ini
]]>
      </screen>
     </example>

    <para>
    You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options.  If you prefer having
    php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in
    step 5.
    </para>
   
    <para>
    If you instead choose php.ini-production, be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.
    </para>

    </listitem>

    <listitem>

 <para>
   Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.
</para>

      <example>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>

      </listitem>

      <listitem>

    <para>
    Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example, let's have
    Apache parse .php files as PHP.  Instead of only using the Apache AddType
    directive, we want to avoid potentially dangerous uploads and created
    files such as exploit.php.jpg from being executed as PHP.  Using this
    example, you could have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding
    them.  We'll add .php to demonstrate.
    </para>


      <example>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
<FilesMatch \.php$>
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>
Or, if we wanted to allow .php, .php2, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, and
    .phtml files to be executed as PHP, but nothing else, we'd use this:
    </para>

      <example>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
<FilesMatch "\.ph(p[2-6]?|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>
    And to allow .phps files to be handled by the php source filter, and
    displayed as syntax-highlighted source code, use this:
    </para>

      <example>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
<FilesMatch "\.phps$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php-source
</FilesMatch>
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>
    mod_rewrite may be used To allow any arbitrary .php file to be displayed 
    as syntax-highlighted source code, without having to rename or copy it 
    to a .phps file:
   </para>

      <example>
        <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*\.php)s$ $1 [H=application/x-httpd-php-source]
]]>
       </programlisting>
      </example>

    <para>
    The php source filter should not be enabled on production systems, where
    it may expose confidential or otherwise sensitive information embedded in
    source code.
    </para>

    </listitem>

    <listitem>
   <para>
   Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:
   </para>
  
   <example>
   <screen>
<![CDATA[
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
]]>
       </screen>
      </example>

          <para>OR</para>

   <example>
   <screen>
<![CDATA[
service httpd restart
]]>
       </screen>
      </example>

   </listitem>
     </orderedlist>

    <para>
     Following the steps above you will have a running Apache2 web server with
     support for PHP as a <literal>SAPI</literal> module.  Of course there are
     many more configuration options available Apache and PHP.  For more
     information type <command>./configure --help</command> in the corresponding
     source tree.
    </para>
    <para>
     Apache may be built multithreaded by selecting the 
     <filename>worker</filename> MPM, rather than the standard 
     <filename>prefork</filename> MPM, when Apache is built. This is done by
     adding the following option to the argument passed to ./configure, in
     step 3 above:
    </para>
    <example>
    <screen>
     --with-mpm=worker
    </screen>
    </example>
    <para>
     This should not be undertaken without being aware of the consequences of 
     this decision, and having at least a fair understanding of
     the implications. The Apache documentation
     regarding <link xlink:href="&url.apache2.mpm;">MPM-Modules</link>
     discusses MPMs in a great deal more detail.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      The <link linkend="faq.installation.apache.multiviews">Apache MultiViews 
      FAQ</link> discusses using multiviews with PHP.
     </para>
    </note>
    <note>
     <para>
      To build a multithreaded version of Apache, the target system must support threads.
      In this case, PHP should also be built with experimental
      Zend Thread Safety (ZTS). Under this configuration, not all extensions will be available.
      The recommended setup is to build Apache with the default 
      <filename>prefork</filename> MPM-Module.
