  This section contains notes and hints specific to Lighttpd 1.4 installs
  of PHP on Unix systems.

 <para>
  Fastcgi is the preferred SAPI to connect PHP and Lighttpd. Fastcgi is
  automagically enabled in php-cgi in PHP 5.3, but for older versions configure
  PHP with --enable-fastcgi.  To confirm that PHP has fastcgi enabled,
  <literal>php -v</literal> should contain <literal>PHP 5.2.5 (cgi-fcgi)</literal>
  Before PHP 5.2.3, fastcgi was enabled on the php binary (there was no php-cgi).

  <title>Letting Lighttpd spawn php processes</title>

  <para>
   To configure Lighttpd to connect to php and spawn fastcgi processes, edit
   lighttpd.conf. Sockets are preferred to connect to fastcgi processes on
   the local system.

  <para>
   The bin-path directive allows lighttpd to spawn fastcgi processes dynamically.
   PHP will spawn children according to the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment
   variable.  The "bin-environment" directive sets the environment for the
   spawned processes. PHP will kill a child process after the number of
   requests specified by PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS is reached. The directives
   "min-procs" and "max-procs" should generally be avoided with PHP. PHP
   manages its own children and opcode caches like APC will only share among
   children managed by PHP. If "min-procs" is set to something greater than 1,
   the total number of php responders will be multiplied PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN
   (2 min-procs * 16 children gives 32 responders).
  </para>

 <sect2 xml:id="install.unix.lighttpd-14.spawn-fcgi">
  <title>Spawning with spawn-fcgi</title>  

  <para>
   Lighttpd provides a program called spawn-fcgi to ease the process of
   spawning fastcgi processes easier.
  </para>

 <sect2 xml:id="install.unix.lighttpd-14.spawn-php">
  <title>Spawning php-cgi</title>

  <para>
   It is possible to spawn processes without spawn-fcgi, though a bit of
   heavy-lifting is required. Setting the PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN environment var
   controls how many children PHP will spawn to handle incoming requests.
   Setting PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS will determine how long (in requests) each
   child will live. Here's a simple bash script to help spawn php responders.
