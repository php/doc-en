   <title>Installation on Unix systems</title>
   <para>
    This section will guide you through the general configuration and
    installation of PHP on Unix systems. Be sure to investigate any
    sections specific to your platform or web server before you begin
    the process.
   </para>
   <para>
    As our manual outlines in the <link linkend="install.general">General
    Installation Considerations</link> section, we are mainly dealing with
    web centric setups of PHP in this section, although we will cover
    setting up PHP for command line usage as well.
   </para>
   <para> 
    There are several ways to install PHP for the Unix platform, either
    with a compile and configure process, or through various
    pre-packaged methods. This documentation is mainly focused around
    the process of compiling and configuring PHP. Many Unix like systems
    have some sort of package installation system. This can assist in
    setting up a standard configuration, but if you need to have a
    different set of features (such as a secure server, or a different
    database driver), you may need to build PHP and/or your web server.
    If you are unfamiliar with building and compiling your own software,
    it is worth checking to see whether somebody has already built a
    packaged version of PHP with the features you need.

    Prerequisite knowledge and software for compiling:

    When building directly from Git sources or after custom modifications you
    might also need:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       autoconf: 2.59+ (for PHP &gt;= 7.0.0), 2.64+ (for PHP &gt;= 7.2.0)
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       automake: 1.4+
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       libtool: 1.4.x+ (except 1.4.2)
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       re2c: 0.13.4+
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       bison:
      </simpara>
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         PHP 7.0 - 7.3: 2.4 or later (including Bison 3.x)
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         PHP 7.4: &gt; 3.0
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
     </listitem>

   </para>
   
   <para>
    The initial PHP setup and configuration process is controlled by the
    use of the command line options of the <command>configure</command>
    script. You could get a list of all available options along with short
    explanations running <command>./configure --help</command>.
    Our manual documents the different options separately. You will
    find the <link linkend="configure.about">core options in the appendix</link>,
    while the different extension specific options are described on the
    reference pages.
   </para>
    
   <para>
    When PHP is configured, you are ready to build the module and/or
    executables. The command <command>make</command> should
    take care of this. If it fails and you can't figure out why, see
    the <link linkend="install.problems">Problems section</link>.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Some Unix systems (such as OpenBSD and SELinux) may disallow mapping pages
     both writable and executable for security reasons, what is called PaX
     MPROTECT or W^X violation protection. This kind of memory mapping is,
     however, necessary for PCRE's JIT support, so either PHP has to be built
     <link linkend="pcre.installation">without PCRE's JIT support</link>, or the
     binary has to be whitelisted by any means provided by the system.
    </para>

     Cross-compiling for ARM with the Android toolchain is currently not supported.
