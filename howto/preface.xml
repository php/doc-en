    This document contains information important for the PHP
    Documentation Group members. If you are interested in the

    Currently this HOWTO is "under construction". When this
    document will be ready, you will find sections here about
    generating HTML documentation from XML sources, adding
    new XML files, or using XSL style sheets to process the
    source files.

    This document is based on many files, previously hosted
    in the phpdoc module at cvs.php.net, containg information
    about several distinct subjects, ranging from generating
    the HTML files from XML sources to starting a new translation.
    This is a central place for all these things. We tried to
    include the original authors in the authors list of this file.
