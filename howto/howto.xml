  <para>
   The PHP documentation is written in XML using the <link
   linkend="docbook">DocBook DTD</link>. If you would like
   to contribute to the PHP documentation work, you need
   to at least know the very basics of XML and DocBook.
  </para>

  <para>
   The XML files are stored on a central server, and
   can be reached with a <link linkend="cvs">CVS</link>
   client. There are many CVS clients out there, although
   we recommend one command line tool.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   You will need more programs and tools to manipulate the
   XML files and test their content for errors. What tools
   you need depends on the operating system you use. Linux
   or some sort of Unix is recommended, although many things
   in phpdoc works on Windows. You will find more information
   about the tools you need in the
   <link linkend="tools-setup">tools</link> section.

  <title>Tools and Setup Instructions</title>
   
  <para>
   What tools you need depends on the operating system you use.
   Linux or some sort of Unix is recommended, although many
   things in phpdoc works on Windows. The very basic things 
   you need to work:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>CVS account</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>CVS client</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>Text editor</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   The basic process is to check out (~download) the file
   using the CVS client, then edit it, and finally commit
   (~upload) it to the server. Of course you can find better
   tools to edit XML files than a simple text editor, it
   is just the absolute minimum. Some more useful tools:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>XML [capable] editor</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>Tools to test the edited file</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   In the folowing paragraphs, you can find information about
   how to obtain these tools and how to make them work for you.
  </para>

  <para>
   The last item in the above list (test the edited file) is
   the hardest to get working, as you need a copy of the English
   and your translations language files from the phpdoc tree. Also
   you need to set up the DocBook files, and several other tools.
   The viewable manual, and other formats such as PDF and RTF, are
   created using <ulink url="&url.jade;">Jade</ulink> and
   <ulink url="&url.nwalsh;">Norman Walsh's Modular DocBook
   Stylesheets</ulink>. There are other tools used to produce some
   other formats and files. It is recommended to set up the style
   sheets and Jade to be able to test your contributions. Otherwise
   you can easily cause headaches to other team members.
  </para>

  <para>
   <emphasis>
    If you have information about other good XML editors and/or tools
    not mentioned here, please send it to the maintainer:

  <sect2 id="tools-on-linux">
   <title>Tools on Linux</title>
  
   <para>
    Although many tools are preinstalled on the majority of
    the Linux systems, we collected some useful information
    about how they can be obtained and installed, if your
    system misses them.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    You will need your favorite text editor and a working
    <link linkend="cvs">CVS</link> installation. Although
    it is possible to use a simple text editor such as vi 
    to write the XML files, it is recommended to use an
    XML/SGML editor that helps you along and makes sure your
    document is proper XML conforming to the used document type
    definition (DTD). A very good (and free) XML/SGML editor
    is Emacs+PSGML. Both Emacs and CVS are already part of just
    about every Linux distribution available.
   </para>

   <para>
    You will also need <ulink url="&url.autoconf;">autoconf</ulink> to
    build the phpdoc GNU configure script. Many distributions come
    with autoconf already installed. The latest copy can be found at:
    <itemizedlist>

    <title>Obtaining the Tools</title>

    <para>
     To simplify the installation process of the tools necessary to
     write PHP documentation, we have chosen to detail how to download
     and install the source RPMs from a sourceware mirror. You will
     need a working copy of <ulink url="&url.rpm;">RPM</ulink> installed
     on the machine you wish to install these tools on.
    </para>

    <para>
     These tools are all separate packages and can be downloaded and
     installed directly from the author's websites if you choose to do
     so. You do not have to use these source RPMs, but installing from
     the author's separate packages is out of the scope of this HOWTO.
    </para>

    <para>
     The RPMs with the necessary software can be downloaded from one of
     the following URLs:

    <para>
     These packages are updated from time to time. Please make sure
     you download the latest version available from the above sites
     (the actual file names may change, so if you find newer files
     than mentioned above, please report, and we can update this list).
    </para>
    
    <note>
     <para>
      We currently use DocBook 3.1.7 (not the latest version) for
      writing phpdoc files. This is because there are
      incompatibilities between DocBook 3.x and 4.x currently not
      corrected in the documentation. Probably we will update
      the XML files, and move to DocBook 4.1.2 soon.

   <sect3 id="tools-on-linux-installing">
    <title>Installing the Tools</title> 

    <para>
     Installing the tools is simple. If you downloaded all of the
     above files into a separate directory by themselves, simply issue
     the folowing command:
    </para>
   
    <para>
     <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
$ rpm -Uvh *.rpm
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
     Or, you can issue them one by one in the following order:
     <informalexample>
      <programlisting>
$ rpm -Uvh docbook-3.x-5.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh jade-1.2.x-4.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh jadetex-2.x-0.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh psgml-1.2.x-1.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh sgml-common-0.1-3.src.rpm
$ rpm -Uvh stylesheets-0.10-2.src.rpm
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
     That's it. You should now have necessary tools installed to edit
     and verify your PHP documentation contributions.

  <sect2 id="tools-on-windows">
   <title>Tools on Windows</title>
  
   <para>
    Although the phpdoc environment is based on many Unix
    tools and techniques, there are ways to accomplish the
    same tasks on Windows. It is not too hard to set up a
    Windows working environment with CVS and the DocBook
    tools, but put away your mouse as you will need the
    keyboard for the majority of the tasks! :)
   </para>
   
   <sect3 id="tools-on-windows-obtaining">
    <title>Obtaining the Tools</title>

    <para>
     You need the same tools as on Linux. The very basic
     thing is a CVS client. You can find one simple command
     line client here at the <ulink url="&url.cvs-win;">CVSHome.org</ulink>
     Win32 download pool. We do not recommend GUI tools such
     as WinCVS, because they can easily screw up the repository
     with files not intended to be there (eg. files with
     uppercased names). The best is to use one command line
     client, as this way you are in control.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     About XML editors, you are encouraged not to use WYSIWYG XML
     editors, such as XML Spy, because the often friendly auto-indent,
     and optimize features can make the XML files so different from
     the one you started the work with, that the diff posted to our
     mailing list and used by translators will be useless. Emacs
     is also available for Windows if you would like to give it a try ;)
    </para>
   
    <para>
     If you want to produce something viewable, or just would
     like to test the modified file before committing (recommended!),
     you need some more tools. To get it running on Windows,
     you'll need these tools:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        <ulink url="&url.win.cygwin;">Cygwin (bash for windows; it's huge...)</ulink>
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>

     </itemizedlist>
     Note that if you use Cygwin, there is no need to download a
     CVS client, as Cygwin comes with a CVS client built in.
    </para>
   </sect3>

   <sect3 id="tools-on-windows-installing">
    <title>Installing the Tools</title> 

    <para>
     You need to download and install the Cygwin tools. 
     Just select the "Install now!" link and run the supplied
     <filename>setup.exe</filename>. It will guide you through
     process of installation. These tools are port of standard
     Unix tools like sed, awk, autoconf, make, perl, ...
     for Windows.
    </para>
    
    <para>
     Run "Cygwin Bash Shell" command from the Programs menu
     (it will be added here by the previous step). Now you get
     a command line which behaves same as bash on Unix boxes.
     If you never worked with bash or Unix before, note that
     there are slashes (/) instead of backslashes (\) in paths.
     If you want to access the <literal>foo</literal> directory
     on drive <literal>c:</literal> write it as
     <literal>c:/foo</literal> instead of <literal>c:\foo.</literal>

     <simpara>
       Do NOT use symlinks with Cygwin, it's buggy. (Jade doesn't
       like them, and the shell doesn't handle them very well either)
     </simpara>
    </warning>
    
    <para>
     Change to the dir where your phpdoc snapshot is (or where you 
     want to have it). Use, just like in Windows, the
     <literal>cd</literal> command. In Cygwin, the
     <literal>dir</literal> command is also supported.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you don't have your snapshot yet, execute CVS (packaged with
     Cygwin). More information about CVS can be found in the
     <link linkend="CVS">CVS section</link> of this document.
    </para>
    
    <note>
     <simpara>
      If you decide to use another directory in one of the next
      steps, you'll probably need to modify
      <filename>phpdoc/configure.in</filename> manually.
      We do not give any support if you are self-opinionated :)
      In this situation you can specify the DSSSL location
      manually by using the

  <title>Working with CVS</title>

  <para>
   The PHP documentation is maintained using <ulink
   url="&url.cvs;">CVS</ulink> (<emphasis>Concurrent
   Versions System</emphasis>). CVS allows the documentation
   contributors to make changes to the different files that make up
   the PHP documentation without stepping on each other's toes.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   A CVS system contains a central server, where all the files
   are stored. A CVS server can host many repositories,
   the name of the repository used by the PHP Documentation
   people is <literal>phpdoc</literal>. To access this
   server, you need a CVS client program on your system.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   When you decide to work on a file, you need to check
   it out (~download the file). Then you can make modifications
   on the file on your local copy. If you are ready, you
   need to commit the changes (~upload the new file). The CVS
   client asks for your short comment about why this commit
   was neccesary. You can give here a summary about what was
   changed. The CVS server stores the history of files with
   these commit messages. Everybody can then see what was
   modified by you, because all modifications generate a diff
   posted to the phpdoc mailing list, and the history is also
   viewable with a CVS client or the web interface at
   <ulink url="&url.php.cvs;">&url.php.cvs;</ulink>. You can
   also delete a file or add one with your CVS client,
   if you see it is needed.
  </para>

  <para>
   This section is not intended to be a CVS tutorial, only a quick
   walkthough to help you get started checking out out the
   <literal>phpdoc</literal> tree and commiting your changes.
   The complete CVS documentation and can be found at <ulink

   You can also type <literal>man cvs</literal> anytime
   you would like to get help about your CVS client. This
   brings up a help text called a "manpage".
  </para>

  <sect2 id="cvs-account">
   <title>Obtaining a CVS Account</title>
   
   <para>
    First, before you can actually make documentation changes, you
    need write access to the <ulink url="&url.php.cvs;">cvs.php.net</ulink>
    CVS repository. You can always checkout a module anonymously,
    but you can not commit changes unless you have an account.
    If you only would like to check files out, you can use
    the read only user name and password. See
    <ulink url="&url.php.anoncvs;">&url.php.anoncvs;</ulink>
    for more information.
   </para>

   <para>
    Also note, that if you have a CVS account on our server,
    you may have no write access to the <literal>phpdoc</literal>
    module. The Karma system controls who have access to what
    repository, so if you have a CVS account but have no Karma
    to write to <literal>phpdoc</literal>, please ask for Karma
    at <ulink url="mailto:&email.group.php;">&email.group.php;</ulink>.
    Note, that who has Karma to write to the PHP source tree,
    has Karma to <literal>phpdoc</literal> as well.
   </para>

   <para>
    Obtaining a CVS account at php.net isn't difficult, but you need
    to do two things:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       Send mail to <ulink
       url="mailto:&email.group.php;">&email.group.php;</ulink>.
       Explain what you would like to do with the CVS account
       (contribute to the PHP documentation). Also give a little
       information and background about yourself so the developers
       understand where you are coming from.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       Once someone from the development team responds to your e-mail,
       you will need to go to <ulink
       url="&url.php.cvsaccount;">&url.php.cvsaccount;</ulink> and fill
       out the formal request form.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>

    </itemizedlist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Both of the above steps and other information about CVS accounts
    at cvs.php.net can be found on the same page as the request form,
    <ulink url="&url.php.cvsaccount;">&url.php.cvsaccount;</ulink>.
    Note that this it not an automated process. If you receive no
    reponse after days, do not hesitate to post your request again.
   </para>

  </sect2> 

  <sect2 id="login">
   <title>CVS Login</title>
   <para>
    Now that you have write access to the CVS repository, let's setup
    a few variables in your <filename>.cvsrc</filename> file, add a
    <literal>CVSROOT</literal> environment variable and
    login to the CVS repository.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you don't already have a <filename>.cvsrc</filename> file in
    your home directory, create one now and add the following lines to
    it. Note that if you use Cygwin, your home directory opens
    first, when running the bash shell (it is the home/username
    directory under your cygwin install directory).
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
cvs -z3
update -d -P
checkout -P
diff -u
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Each time you issue commands to the CVS repository, you have to
    specify the repository's cvsroot directory like this:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs -d :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository checkout <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Instead of telling <command>cvs</command> where the repository is
    each time, you can set a default CVS repository in your <literal
    >CVSROOT</literal> environment variable.
   </para>

   <para>
    For <literal>sh</literal> and <literal>bash</literal>
    users add the following to your <filename>.bashrc</filename>
    or <filename>.profile</filename> file.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
CVSROOT=:pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository
export CVSROOT
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    For <literal>csh</literal> and <literal>tcsh</literal>
    users add the following to your <filename>.cshrc</filename>
    or <filename>.tcshrc</filename> file.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
setenv CVSROOT :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The <literal>CVSROOT</literal> environment variable
     won't be set until the next time you log in.
    </para>
   </note>
   
   <para>
    If you use Windows, use your regular way to add the new
    environment variable, according to the Windows version
    you are using (use the <command>set</command> command
    on Windows 9x, or the Dialog box for setting environment
    variables on Windows 2000).
   </para>

   <para>
    Now that you have the prep work out of they way, you will need to
    login to the CVS repository. Issue the following command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs login
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Or, if you don't have your <literal>CVSROOT</literal>
    set, make sure you supply the correct <literal>cvsroot</literal>:

     <programlisting>
$ cvs -d :pserver:<parameter>username</parameter>@cvs.php.net:/repository login
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    Change the <parameter>username</parameter> above to your own
    CVS user name. You will be asked to supply your password. Once
    you successfully login to the CVS respository, your encrypted
    password is stored in the <filename>.cvspass</filename> file
    in your home directory. You won't need to log back into the
    same repository again unless you delete that file (or
    issue a <literal>cvs logout</literal>).
   </para>

  <sect2 id="checkout">
   <title>Checking Out a Module</title> 

   <para>
    Now it's time to checkout the <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
    module. Incidently, a module is a collection of source
    directories and files. Usually it's simply a directory tree in
    the CVS repository.
   </para>

   <para>
    <command>cd</command> to a directory you wish to store the
    <literal>phpdoc</literal> tree under. Wherever you decide to
    put it, a <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory will be created

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs checkout <parameter>phpdoc</parameter>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    After some status information about the checkout scrolls by, you
    should have a full working copy of the <literal>phpdoc</literal>
    module.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     You are not completely free to decide where this
     <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory should be. See the
     <link linkend="tools-setup">Tools and Setup Instructions</link>
     section for more precise information about whether the

  <sect2 id="update">
   <title>Updating the Tree</title> 

   <para>
    It's a good idea from time to time to update your copy of the
    <parameter>phpdoc</parameter> tree so that you always have the
    latest copy. Currently, changes to the tree are made daily so you
    should always update your copy before making changes yourself.
   </para>

    command:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs update
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you only wish to update a particular file or set of files you
    would like to modify, you can pass their filenames along with the

     <programlisting>
$ cvs update <parameter>file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>file2</parameter></optional>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    If the files are located beneath the top level
    <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory, use the relative paths of
    the filenames:

     <programlisting>
$ cvs update <parameter>en/functions/file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>en/chapters/file2</parameter></optional>

   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="status">
   <title>Checking the Status of Files</title>

   <para>
    If you've made several changes to your local copy of
    <literal>phpdoc</literal> and would like to see what files
    have been modified, you can ask <command>cvs</command> what the
    current status of the file or files is.
   </para>

   <para>
    To see the status of all files in the current directory, issue the
    following command:

     <programlisting>
$ cvs status -l
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    This will usually generate a huge list, but you can narrow down
    the status information by supplying <command>cvs</command>
    specific filenames to check the status of:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ cvs status <parameter>file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>file2</parameter></optional>

   </para>

   <para>
    When commiting a file or files to the repository, it is polite to
    supply a brief message of what you have changed. You do not need
    to document every single line you changed, that is part of CVS'
    job. However, it is helpful to see a brief summary of what has
    changed from version to version without having to study the file
    itself.

$ cvs commit -m 'added new blah() function' <parameter>file1</parameter> <optional><parameter>file2</parameter></optional>
     </programlisting>

    Sometimes it is more convinient to ommit the

    To generate a viewable copy of the documenation,
    <command>cd</command> to the <filename>phpdoc</filename> directory
    and issue one of the following commands:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ make html
$ make bightml
$ make phpweb
$ make pdf
$ make rtf
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    To make an actual copy of this HOWTO:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ make howto
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    The plain text version of the PHP documentation is made
    by filtering the <literal>bightml</literal> output through lynx.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Generating viewable documentation is CPU intensive and can take a
     little while to complete. E.g. generating the simple HTML 
     manual takes about 7m 30s on a 700MHz box.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    Where the output files are placed depends on the format you
    built. HTML manuals generate in the <filename>html</filename>
    subdirectory of <literal>phpdoc</literal>, similarly the
    <literal>make phpweb</literal> command will place the files
    in the <filename>php</filename> directory. The place for
    the HOWTO HTML files is <filename>howto/html</filename>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    If all goes well, you should have your own copy of the
    documentation, including any changes you've made.

   <title>Using XSL Stylesheets</title>

   <para>
    Currently using XSL stylesheets to generate output
    of XML files is not as well supported as using DSSSL
    style sheets. This is because XSL stylesheets are not
    as customized as DSSL ones, and XSL tools are not as
    widely used, and standardized.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    At this time there are no XSL specific targets in
    <filename>Makefile</filename>. This is because there
    are not standardized ways to invoke XSLT processors.
    To use XSL stylesheets you must run the
    <filename>configure</filename> script and tell it,
    where your copy of XSL DocBook Stylesheets is placed.
    The majority of XSLT processors require an URL instead
    of a filename, so be sure to prepend
    the <literal>file:///</literal> schema before path:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --with-xsl=file:///path/to/docbook/xsl/styles
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Configure will create four files:
    <filename>html.xsl</filename>,
    <filename>bightml.xsl</filename>,
    <filename>htmlhelp.xsl</filename>,
    <filename>print.xsl</filename> among others. These files
    can be used to generate the desired output.
    <filename>html.xsl</filename> generates a set of small
    HTML files, <filename>bightml.xsl</filename> generates
    one large HTML file, <filename>htmlhelp.xsl</filename>
    generates source files processable by HTML Help Workshop
    and <filename>print.xsl</filename> generates a file
    with FO objects suitable for further processing with
    some FO processor.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Invocation of XSLT processor is processor dependent,
    for now suppose that you have a shell script called
    <filename>saxon</filename> which is able to invoke the
    Saxon processor. Some examples:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
$ mkdir html
$ saxon manual.xml html.xsl
$ saxon manual.xml htmlhelp.xsl
$ saxon -o bigmanual.html manual.xml bightml.xsl
$ saxon -o manual.fo manual.xml print.xsl
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
    Use the appropriate command from the examples above
    to generate the desired output as described above.
    If you would like to generate HTML Help output, you
    must run the Microsoft HTML Help Compiler after
    processing. To get a PDF from the FO file, you must
    run some FO processor on the
    <filename>manual.fo</filename> file.
   </para>
   
   <note>
    <para>
     Generating <filename>bigmanual.html</filename> with Saxon
     (using JDK 1.3) takes about two minutes on a Celeron 400
     computer. Generating FO files takes about two times more
     + plus time required to run the FO processor. Generating
     chunked version or HTML Help version of manual takes about
     60 minutes.
    </para>
   </note>
   
   <note>
    <para>
     Not all customization from DSSSL are backported to XSL,
     so some things are not as pretty as in DSSSL output
     <emphasis>currently</emphasis>.

    If you are used to HTML, DocBook will probably seem pretty
    tag-verbose to you. DocBook also uses logical tags, it has no
    (or at least very few) layout-specific tags like HTML is full of.
    The idea with DocBook is to tell as much as you can about the
    information while writing it, so that software can do more things
    with it.
   </para>
   <para>
    We use DocBook, because it eases the generation of the several
    formats of the documentation, and acts as a central "meta format"
    for all the things we would like to express in the documentation.
   </para>
   <para>
    You cannot just invent tags in DocBook. There is a standard
    set of tags you can use. If you are working on a translation,
    plase do not translate tags, as they need to stay as they
    was written in the English files to work properly.

      Only major functions should be documented; functions which are
      deprecated variants may be mentioned, but should not be

      Brevity is appreciated. Long winded descriptions of each and

  <a name="connecting.phpdoc"></a><h2>3.1. New SGML files</h2>

   The main file for the documentation is <tt>manual.sgml</tt>.  This
   file uses <i>entities</i> (can be compared to a combination of #define
   and #include in C) to include text from other files.  The entities
   that include the PHPDOC files are defined in the <i>preamble</i> of
  <tt>manual.sgml</tt>, which is the section between the "[" character
   on the first (DOCTYPE) line and "]&gt;".

  <p> Steps involved in connecting a new PHPDOC file:

  <ol>
  <li> Let us say you have written functions/ldap.phpdoc.  You should
   then add this to the preamble:
  <pre>
  <b>&lt;!entity ldapref system "functions/ldap.sgml"&gt;</b>
  </pre>

   This tells the SGML parser that when "ldapref" is referenced it
   should read the file <tt>functions/ldap.sgml</tt>.<p> <em>Note
   that the file name extension used here is not <tt>.phpdoc</tt>,
   but <tt>.sgml</tt>.  The Makefile handles the conversion.</em>
  <p>

  <li> Refer to the <i>ldapref</i> entity where you want to include it.
   Keep in mind that PHPDOC documents are converted into LINUXDOC
   sections.  Internal functions should be added to the "internal
   functions" chapter in <tt>chapters/functions.sgml</tt>.  Add
   something like this (the bold part is what to add):
  <pre>
   &lt;chapt&gt;Internal functions
   ...
  <b>&amp;ldapref;</b>
   ...
  </pre>

  <li> Then, to make sure the .phpdoc file is converted to .sgml,
   you have to tell make about it.  Add the <u>.sgml</u> file to
   the FUNCREF variable in <tt>Makefile.in</tt>.  Example (the bold
   text is the change):
  <pre>
   FUNCREF=functions/oracle.sgml \
  <b>functions/ldap.sgml \</b>
   functions/math.sgml \
   functions/mysql.sgml \
   functions/pgsql.sgml \
   functions/strings.sgml \
   functions/adabas.sgml
  </pre>

  <li> Finally, regenerate <tt>Makefile</tt>:
  <pre>
   (cd .. ; ./config.status)
  </pre>

  </ol>

  <a name="connecting.labels"></a><h2>3.2. Label name conventions</h2>

   When making or refering to labels in the LINUXDOC files, there are
   some conventions that should kept:

  <ul>
  <li> Internal functions have labels of the form
  <tt>func:<i>function_name</i></tt>.
  <li> Arguments to configure (when installing) have labels like the
   argument names.  For example, the -with-system-regex option has
   the label <tt>with_system_regex</tt>
  </ul>
