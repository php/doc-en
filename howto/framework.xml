  <title>The PHP Documentation Framework</title>

  <para>
   The PHP documentation is written in XML using the <link
   linkend="chapter-docbook">DocBook DTD</link>. If you would like
   to contribute to the PHP documentation project, you need
   to at least know the very basics of XML and DocBook.
  </para>

  <para>
   The XML files are stored on a central server, and
   can be reached with a <link linkend="chapter-cvs">CVS</link>
   client. There are many CVS clients you can use, although
   we recommend one command line tool or a proven WYSIWYG tool.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   You will need more programs and tools to manipulate the
   XML files and test their content for errors. What tools
   you need depends on the operating system you use. Linux
   or some sort of Unix is recommended, although many things
   in phpdoc work on Windows. You will find more information
   about the tools you need in the
   <link linkend="chapter-tools">tools</link> section.
