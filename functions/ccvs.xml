  <title>CCVS API Functions</title>

  <partintro>
   <simpara>
    These functions interface the CCVS API, allowing you to directly
    work with CCVS from your PHP scripts.  CCVS is <ulink
    url="&url.redhat;">RedHat's</ulink> solution to the "middle-man"
    in credit card processing.  It lets you directly address the
    credit card clearing houses via your *nix box and a modem.  Using
    the CCVS module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
    through CCVS via your PHP Scripts.  The following references will
    outline the process.

    To enable CCVS Support in PHP, first verify your CCVS installation
    directory.  You will then need to configure PHP with the <option
    role="configure">--with-ccvs</option> option. If you use this
    option without specifying the path to your CCVS installation, PHP
    Will attempt to look in the default CCVS Install location
    (/usr/local/ccvs). If CCVS is in a non-standard location, run
    configure with: <option
    role="configure">--with-ccvs=$ccvs_path</option>, where $ccvs_path
    is the path to your CCVS installation.  Please note that CCVS
    support requires that $ccvs_path/lib and $ccvs_path/include exist,
    and include cv_api.h under the include directory and libccvs.a
    under the lib directory.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Additionally, a ccvsd process will need to be running for the
    configurations you intend to use in your PHP scripts. You will
    also need to make sure the PHP Processes are running under the
    same user as your CCVS was installed as (e.g. if you installed
    CCVS as user 'ccvs', your PHP processes must run as 'ccvs' as
    well.)

    This documentation section is being worked on.  Until then, RedHat
    maintains slightly outdated but still useful documentation at
    <ulink url="&url.redhat.support;">&url.redhat.support;</ulink>.
