TODO for the PHP documentation project.

Add things that should be updated/added in the documentation here. For
big (i.e. time-consuming) items, add your name to it when you start
working on it, to prevent double-work.

DISCUSSIONS:
  - language styleguide in howto (for english) and translation
    trees (for the other languages)

BIG JOBS:
  - Document all BC breaks and Deprecations, having them listed
    at a single location.
  - build PDF's
      - see: RFC/pdf_problems
  - Move the "developers manual" (internals) to http://dev.php.net
      - see: RFC/manual_splitting
  - integrate the meeting findings from the protocol
      - see: RFC/protocol_20020310
  - document every undocumented function.
        see: http://www.phpdoc.info/meta/phpsrc-vs-phpdoc.php
             http://doc.php.net/php/undoc_functions.php
  - add an example to most every function
      - see: http://doc.php.net/php/missing_examples.php
             http://www.phpdoc.info/meta/missing-examples.php
  - improve doc.php.net
      - see: http://doc.php.net/
             http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=107546888406223
             http://news.php.net/php.doc.web
             http://cvs.php.net/docweb/
  - Add E_DEPRECATED appendix that explains features that will be removed,
    and include future friendly examples
  - Add PHP 5.3 migration guide

BUILD SYSTEM:
  - get back lost indexes, but add them as appendices
    (index of tables, index of examples, index of config options)
  - add legacy.ent
      - see: http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=phpdoc&m=103893809326045
  - generate a list of all php.ini configure options
  - generate a list of all install configure options
  - generate a list of all examples
  - generate a list of all requirements from all resources.xml

GENERAL:
  - Go through the FIXMEs comments (most of them upgrade to the new-oo-style)
  - Document php://stdout etc feature for file functions.
    (superseded by need of general description of the new streams features?)
  - Add &note.not-threadsafe; to each extension/function
    that is not thread safe
  - go through and make sure every function that takes on a parameter
    by reference has an example that clearly demonstrates that it's
    not a reference passed at call time.
  - Add a pointers section, perhaps in types.array
  - Tool: check all 'see also' links and ensure they are valid. For 
    example, make sure a function exists.
