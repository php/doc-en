    PHP allows developers to declare constructor methods for classes.
    Classes which have a constructor method call this method on each
    newly-created object, so it is suitable for any initialization that the
    object may need before it is used.

     Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the child class defines
     a constructor.  In order to run a parent constructor, a call to
     <function>parent::__construct</function> within the child constructor is
     required. If the child does not define a constructor then it may be inherited
     from the parent class just like a normal class method (if it was not declared
     as private).

    Constructors are ordinary methods which are called during the instantiation of their
    corresponding object.  As such, they may define an arbitrary number of arguments, which
    may be required, may have a type, and may have a default value. Constructor arguments
    are called by placing the arguments in parentheses after the class name.

    <title>Old-style constructors</title>
    <para>
     Prior to PHP 8.0.0, classes in the global namespace will interpret a method named
     the same as the class as an old-style constructor.  That syntax is deprecated,
     and will result in an <constant>E_DEPRECATED</constant> error but still call that function as a constructor.
     If both <link linkend="object.construct">__construct()</link> and a same-name method are
     defined, <link linkend="object.construct">__construct()</link> will be called.
    </para>
    <para>
     In namespaced classes, or any class as of PHP 8.0.0, a method named
     the same as the class never has any special meaning.
    </para>
    <para>Always use <link linkend="object.construct">__construct()</link> in new code.

   <sect3 xml:id="language.oop5.decon.constructor.promotion">
    <title>Constructor Promotion</title>
    <para>
     As of PHP 8.0.0, constructor parameters may also be promoted to correspond to an
     object property.  It is very common for constructor parameters to be assigned to
     a property in the constructor but otherwise not operated upon.  Constructor promotion
     provides a short-hand for that use case.  The example above could be rewritten as the following.
    </para>
    <example>
     <title>Using constructor property promotion</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
class Point {
    public function __construct(protected int $x, protected int $y = 0) {
    }
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </example>
    <para>
     When a constructor argument includes a modifier, PHP will interpret it as
     both an object property and a constructor argument, and assign the argument value to
     the property.  The constructor body may then be empty or may contain other statements.
     Any additional statements will be executed after the argument values have been assigned
     to the corresponding properties.
    </para>
    <para>
     Not all arguments need to be promoted. It is possible to mix and match promoted and not-promoted
     arguments, in any order.  Promoted arguments have no impact on code calling the constructor.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      Using a <link linkend="language.oop5.visibility">visibility modifier</link> (<literal>public</literal>,
      <literal>protected</literal> or <literal>private</literal>) is the most likely way to apply property
      promotion, but any other single modifier (such as <literal>readonly</literal>) will have the same effect.
     </para>
    </note>
    <note>
     <para>
      Object properties may not be typed <type>callable</type> due to engine ambiguity that would
      introduce. Promoted arguments, therefore, may not be typed <type>callable</type> either. Any
      other <link linkend="language.types.declarations">type declaration</link> is permitted, however.
     </para>
    </note>
    <note>
     <para>
      As promoted properties are desugared to both a property as well as a function parameter, any
      and all naming restrictions for both properties as well as parameters apply.

      <link linkend="language.attributes">Attributes</link> placed on a

     As of PHP 8.1.0, objects can be used as default parameter values,

    <title>Static creation methods</title>
    <para>
     PHP only supports a single constructor per class.  In some cases, however, it may be
     desirable to allow an object to be constructed in different ways with different inputs.
     The recommended way to do so is by using static methods as constructor wrappers.

     The constructor may be made private or protected to prevent it from being called externally.
     If so, only a static method will be able to instantiate the class. Because they are in the
     same class definition they have access to private methods, even if not of the same object
     instance. The private constructor is optional and may or may not make sense depending on
     the use case.
    </para>
    <para>
     The three public static methods then demonstrate different ways of instantiating the object.
    </para>
    <simplelist>
     <member><code>fromBasicData()</code> takes the exact parameters that are needed, then creates the
      object by calling the constructor and returning the result.</member>
     <member><code>fromJson()</code> accepts a JSON string and does some pre-processing on it itself
     to convert it into the format desired by the constructor. It then returns the new object.</member>
     <member><code>fromXml()</code> accepts an XML string, preprocesses it, and then creates a bare
     object.  The constructor is still called, but as all of the parameters are optional the method
     skips them.  It then assigns values to the object properties directly before returning the result.</member>
    </simplelist>
    <para>
     In all three cases, the <code>static</code> keyword is translated into the name of the class the code is in.
     In this case, <code>Product</code>.

    PHP possesses a destructor concept similar to that of other
    object-oriented languages, such as C++. The destructor method will be
    called as soon as there are no other references to a particular object,
    or in any order during the shutdown sequence.

    <title>Destructor Example</title>

        print "In constructor\n";
    }

    function __destruct() {
        print "Destroying " . __CLASS__ . "\n";
    }
}

$obj = new MyDestructableClass();
 
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </example>
   <para>
    Like constructors, parent destructors will not be called implicitly by
    the engine. In order to run a parent destructor, one would have to
    explicitly call <function>parent::__destruct</function> in the destructor
    body. Also like constructors, a child class may inherit the parent's
    destructor if it does not implement one itself.
   </para>
   <para>
    The destructor will be called even if script execution is stopped using
    <function>exit</function>. Calling <function>exit</function> in a destructor
    will prevent the remaining shutdown routines from executing.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a destructor creates new references to its object, it will not be called
    a second time when the reference count reaches zero again or during the
    shutdown sequence.
   </para>
   <para>
    As of PHP 8.4.0, when
    <link linkend="features.gc.collecting-cycles">cycle collection</link>
    occurs during the execution of a
    <link linkend="language.fibers">Fiber</link>, the destructors of objects
    scheduled for collection are executed in a separate Fiber, called the
    <literal>gc_destructor_fiber</literal>.
    If this Fiber is suspended, a new one will be created to execute any
    remaining destructors.
    The previous <literal>gc_destructor_fiber</literal> will no longer be
    referenced by the garbage collector and may be collected if it is not
    referenced elsewhere.
    Objects whose destructor are suspended will not be collected until the
    destructor returns or the Fiber itself is collected.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Destructors called during the script shutdown have HTTP headers already
     sent. The working directory in the script shutdown phase can be different
     with some SAPIs (e.g. Apache).

     Attempting to throw an exception from a destructor (called in the time of
