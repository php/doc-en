  <title>Static Keyword</title>

  <para>
   Declaring class members or methods as static, makes them callable
   from outside the object context. A member or method declared
   with static can not be accessed with a variable that is an instance
   of the object and cannot be re-defined in an extending class.
  </para>

  <para>
   The static declaration must be after the visibility declaration. For 
   compatibility with PHP 4, if no <link
   linkend="language.oop5.visibility">visibility</link>
   declaration is used, then the member or method will be treated
   as if it was declared as <literal>public static</literal>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Because static methods are callable without an instance of
   the object created, the pseudo variable <varname>$this</varname> is
   not available inside the method declared as static.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   In fact <literal>static</literal> method calls are resolved at compile 
   time. When using an explicit class name the method is already identified
   completley and no inheritance rules apply. If the call is done by 
   <literal>self</literal> then <literal>self</literal> is translated to 
   the current class, that is the class the code belongs to. Here also no 
   inheritance rules apply.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   Static properties cannot be accessed through the object using the arrow
   operator -&gt;.
  </para>
