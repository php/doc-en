  <title>Object Cloning</title>
  
  <para>
   Creating a copy of an object with fully replicated properties is not
   always the wanted behavior. A good example of the need for copy
   constructors, is if you have an object which represents a GTK window and the
   object holds the resource of this GTK window, when you create a duplicate
   you might want to create a new window with the same properties and have the
   new object hold the resource of the new window. Another example is if your
   object holds a reference to another object which it uses and when you
   replicate the parent object you want to create a new instance of this other
   object so that the replica has its own separate copy.
  </para>

  <para>
   An object copy is created by using the clone keyword (which calls the
   object's __clone() method if possible). An object's __clone()  method
   cannot be called directly.
  </para>

  <para>
   When an object is cloned, PHP 5 will perform a shallow copy of all of the
   object's properties. Any properties that are references to other variables,
   will remain references.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once the cloning is complete, if a __clone() method is defined, then
   the newly created object's __clone() method will be called, to allow any
   necessary properties that need to be changed.
  </para>
