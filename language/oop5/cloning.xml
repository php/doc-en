  <title>Object cloning</title>
  
  <para>
  Creating a copy of an object with fully replicated properties is not
  always the wanted behavior. A good example of the need for copy
  constructors, is if you have an object which represents a GTK window and the
  object holds the resource of this GTK window, when you create a duplicate
  you might want to create a new window with the same properties and have the
  new object hold the resource of the new window. Another example is if your
  object holds a reference to another object which it uses and when you
  replicate the parent object you want to create a new instance of this other
  object so that the replica has its own separate copy.
  </para>

  <para>
   An object copy is created by using the clone keyword (which calls the
   object's __clone() method if possible). An object's __clone()  method
   cannot be called directly.

  <para>
   When the developer asks to create a new copy of an object, PHP 5 will check
   if a __clone() method has been defined or not. If not, it will call a
   default __clone() which will copy all of the object's properties. If a
   __clone() method is defined, then it will be responsible to set the
   necessary properties in the created object. For convenience, the engine
   will supply a function that imports all of the properties from the source
   object, so that they can start with a by-value replica of the source
   object, and only override properties that need to be changed.

   function __clone() {
       $this->address = "New York";
       $this->id = self::$id++;
   }
}

$obj = new MyCloneable();

$obj->name = "Hello";
