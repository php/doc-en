  <title>Late Static Bindings</title>
  <para>
   PHP implements a feature called late static bindings which
   can be used to reference the called class in a context of static inheritance.
  </para>

  <para>
   More precisely, late static bindings work by storing the class named in the
   last "non-forwarding call". In case of static method calls, this is the
   class explicitly named (usually the one on the left of the
   <link linkend="language.oop5.paamayim-nekudotayim"><literal>::</literal></link>
   operator); in case of non static method calls, it is the class of the object. A
   "forwarding call" is a static one that is introduced by <literal>self::</literal>,
   <literal>parent::</literal>, <literal>static::</literal>, or, if going
   up in the class hierarchy, <function>forward_static_call</function>.
   <!-- technically, static:: may be non forwarding, but it's irrelevant -->
   
   The function <function>get_called_class</function> can be used to retrieve
   a string with the name of the called class and <literal>static::</literal>
   introduces its scope.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   This feature was named "late static bindings" with an internal perspective in
   mind. "Late binding" comes from the fact that <literal>static::</literal>
   will not be resolved using the class where the method is defined but it will
   rather be computed using runtime information.

   It was also called a "static binding" as it can be used for (but is not
   limited to) static method calls.

   <title>Limitations of <literal>self::</literal></title>
   <para>
    Static references to the current class like <literal>self::</literal> or
    <literal>__CLASS__</literal> are resolved using the class in which the
    function belongs, as in where it was defined:

   <title>Late Static Bindings' usage</title>

   <para>
    Late static bindings tries to solve that limitation by introducing a
    keyword that references the class that was initially called at runtime.
    Basically, a keyword that would allow referencing
    <literal>B</literal> from <literal>test()</literal> in the previous
    example. It was decided not to introduce a new keyword but rather use
    <literal>static</literal> that was already reserved.

   <note>
    <para>
     In non-static contexts, the called class will be the class of the object
     instance. Since <literal>$this-></literal> will try to call private
     methods from the same scope, using <literal>static::</literal> may give
     different results. Another difference is that <literal>static::</literal>
     can only refer to static properties.

     Late static bindings' resolution will stop at a fully resolved static call
     with no fallback. On the other hand, static calls using keywords like
     <literal>parent::</literal> or <literal>self::</literal> will forward the
     calling information.
