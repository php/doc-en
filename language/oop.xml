    A class is a collection of variables and functions working with
    these variables.  A class is defined using the following syntax:

    The following cautionary notes are valid for PHP 4.
   </simpara>
    
   <caution>
    <simpara>
     The name <literal>stdClass</literal> is used interally by
     Zend and is reserved. You cannot have a class named
     <literal>stdClass</literal> in PHP.
    </simpara>
   </caution>
    
   <caution>
    <simpara>
      The function names <literal>__sleep</literal> and
      <literal>__wakeup</literal> are magical in PHP classes. You
      cannot have functions with these names in any of your
      classes unless you want the magic functionality associated
      with them. See below for more information.
    </simpara>
   </caution>
    
   <caution>
    <simpara>
      PHP reserves all function names starting with __ as magical.
      It is recommended that you do not use function names with
      __ in PHP unless you want some documented magic functionality.
    </simpara>
   </caution>

   <simpara>
    In PHP 4, only constant initializers for <literal>var</literal>
    variables are allowed. To initialize variables with non-constant
    values, you need an initialization function which is called
    automatically when an object is being constructed from the
    class. Such a function is called a constructor (see below).
   </simpara>
   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
class Cart
{
    /* None of these will work in PHP 4. */
    var $todays_date = date("Y-m-d");
    var $name = $firstname;
    var $owner = 'Fred ' . 'Jones';
    /* Arrays containing constant values will, though. */
    var $items = array("VCR", "TV");
}

/* This is how it should be done. */
class Cart
{
    var $todays_date;
    var $name;
    var $owner;
    var $items = array("VCR", "TV");

    function Cart()
    {
        $this->todays_date = date("Y-m-d");
        $this->name = $GLOBALS['firstname'];
        /* etc. . . */
    }
}
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <para>
    Classes are types, that is, they are blueprints for actual
    variables. You have to create a variable of the desired type with
    the <literal>new</literal> operator.
   </para>
 
   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$cart = new Cart;
$cart->add_item("10", 1);

$another_cart = new Cart;
$another_cart->add_item("0815", 3);
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>
 
   <para>
    This creates the objects <varname>$cart</varname> and
    <varname>$another_cart</varname>, both of the class Cart. The function
    add_item() of the <varname>$cart</varname> object is being called to add 1
    item of article number 10 to the <varname>$cart</varname>. 3 items of
    article number 0815 are being added to <varname>$another_cart</varname>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Both, <varname>$cart</varname> and <varname>$another_cart</varname>, have
    functions add_item(), remove_item() and a variable items. These are
    distinct functions and variables. You can think of the objects as
    something similar to directories in a filesystem. In a filesystem you can
    have two different files README.TXT, as long as they are in different
    directories.  Just like with directories where you'll have to type the
    full pathname in order to reach each file from the toplevel directory, you
    have to specify the complete name of the function you want to call: In PHP
    terms, the toplevel directory would be the global namespace, and the
    pathname separator would be <literal>-&gt;</literal>.  Thus, the names
    <varname>$cart-&gt;items</varname> and
    <varname>$another_cart-&gt;items</varname> name two different variables.
    Note that the variable is named <varname>$cart-&gt;items</varname>, not
    <varname>$cart-&gt;$items</varname>, that is, a variable name in PHP has
    only a single dollar sign.
   </para>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// correct, single $
$cart->items = array("10" => 1); 

// invalid, because $cart->$items becomes $cart->""
$cart->$items = array("10" => 1);

// correct, but may or may not be what was intended:
// $cart->$myvar becomes $cart->items
$myvar = 'items';
$cart->$myvar = array("10" => 1);  
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <para>
    Within a class definition, you do not know under which name the object
    will be accessible in your program: at the time the Cart class was
    written, it was unknown that the object will be named
    <varname>$cart</varname> or <varname>$another_cart</varname> later. Thus,
    you cannot write <varname>$cart-&gt;items</varname> within the Cart class
    itself. Instead, in order to be able to access it's own functions and
    variables from within a class, one can use the pseudo-variable
    <varname>$this</varname> which can be read as 'my own' or 'current
    object'. Thus, '<varname>$this-&gt;items[$artnr]</varname> +=
    <varname>$num</varname>' can be read as 'add <varname>$num</varname> to
    the <varname>$artnr</varname> counter of my own items array' or 'add
    <varname>$num</varname> to the <varname>$artnr</varname> counter of the
    items array within the current object'.

    There are some nice functions to handle classes and objects. You might want

   <title><literal>extends</literal></title>

   <para>
    Often you need classes with similar variables and functions
    to another existing class. In fact, it is good practice to
    define a generic class which can be used in all your
    projects and adapt this class for the needs of each of your
    specific projects. To facilitate this, classes can be
    extensions of other classes.  The extended or derived class
    has all variables and functions of the base class (this is
    called 'inheritance' despite the fact that nobody died) and what
    you add in the extended definition. It is not possible to
    substract from a class, that is, to undefine any existing 
    functions or variables. An extended class is always dependent
    on a single base class, that is, multiple inheritance is
    not supported. Classes are extended using the keyword 'extends'.

   <para>
    This defines a class Named_Cart that has all variables and functions of
    Cart plus an additional variable <varname>$owner</varname> and an
    additional function set_owner(). You create a named cart the usual way and
    can now set and get the carts owner. You can still use normal cart
    functions on named carts:

    </programlisting>

   <para>
    This is also called a "parent-child" relationship. You create a class,
    parent, and use <literal>extends</literal> to create a new class
    <emphasis>based</emphasis> on the parent class: the child class. You can
    even use this new child class and create another class based on this child
    class.
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     Classes must be defined before they are used! If you want the class
     <literal>Named_Cart</literal> to extend the class
     <literal>Cart</literal>, you will have to define the class
     <literal>Cart</literal> first. If you want to create another class called
     <literal>Yellow_named_cart</literal> based on the class
     <literal>Named_Cart</literal> you have to define
     <literal>Named_Cart</literal> first. To make it short: the order in which
     the classes are defined is important.

   <title><literal>Constructors</literal></title>

   <caution>
    <simpara>
     In PHP 3 and PHP 4 constructors behave differently. The PHP 4
     semantics are strongly preferred.
    </simpara>
   </caution>

   <para>
    Constructors are functions in a class that are automatically
    called when you create a new instance of a class with
    <literal>new</literal>. In PHP 3, a
    function becomes a constructor when it has the same name as 
    the class. In PHP 4, a function becomes a constructor, when
    it has the same name as the class it is defined in - the
    difference is subtle, but crucial (see below).

   <para>
    This defines a class Auto_Cart that is a Cart plus a constructor
    which initializes the cart with one item of article number "10"
    each time a new Auto_Cart is being made with "new". Constructors
    can take arguments and these arguments can be optional, which
    makes them much more useful. To be able to still use the class
    without parameters, all parameters to constructors should be
    made optional by providing default values.

    <literal>@new</literal>.
   </para>

   <caution>
    <simpara>
     In PHP 3, derived classes and constructors have a number of
     limitations. The following examples should be read carefully
     to understand these limitations.
    </simpara> 
   </caution>
   
   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">

    function A()

   <para>
    In PHP 3, no constructor is being called in the above example.
    The rule in PHP 3 is: 'A constructor is a function of the same
    name as the class.'. The name of the class is B, and there is
    no function called B() in class B. Nothing happens.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    This is fixed in PHP 4 by introducing another rule: If a class
    has no constructor, the constructor of the base class is being
    called, if it exists. The above example would have printed
    'I am the constructor of A.&lt;br&gt;' in PHP 4.

   </informalexample>
   
   <para>
    In PHP 3, the function B() in class A will suddenly become a
    constructor in class B, although it was never intended to be.
    The rule in PHP 3 is: 'A constructor is a function of the same
    name as the class.'. PHP 3 does not care if the function is
    being defined in class B, or if it has been inherited.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    This is fixed in PHP 4 by modifying the rule to: 'A constructor
    is a function of the same name as the class it is being defined
    in.'. Thus in PHP 4, the class B would have no constructor function
    of its own and the constructor of the base class would have been
    called, printing 'I am the constructor of A.&lt;br&gt;'.
   </para>
   
   <caution>
    <simpara>
     Neither PHP 3 nor PHP 4 call constructors of the base class 
     automatically from a constructor of a derived class. It is
     your responsibility to propagate the call to constructors
     upstream where appropriate.
    </simpara>
   </caution>
   
   <note>
    <simpara>
     There are no destructors in PHP 3 or PHP 4. You may use
     <function>register_shutdown_function</function> instead
     to simulate most effects of destructors.
    </simpara>
   </note>
   
   <para>
    Destructors are functions that are called automatically
    when an object is destroyed, either with <function>unset</function>
    or by simply going out of scope. There are no destructors
    in PHP.

    Sometimes it is useful to refer to functions and variables

   <para>
    The above example calls the function example() in
    class A, but there is no object of class A, so that
    we cannot write $a->example() or similar. Instead we
    call example() as a 'class function', that is, as a
    function of the class itself, not any object of that
    class.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    There are class functions, but there are no class variables.
    In fact, there is no object at all at the time of the call.
    Thus, a class function may not use any object variables (but
    it can use local and global variables), and it may no use
    <varname>$this</varname> at all.
   </para>

   <para>
    In the above example, class B redefines the function example(). 
    The original definition in class A is shadowed
    and no longer available, unless you are referring specifically
    to the implementation of example() in class A using the 
    ::-operator. Write A::example() to do this (in fact, you
    should be writing parent::example(), as shown in the next
    section).
   </para>
   
   <para>
    In this context, there is a current object and it may have object
    variables. Thus, when used from WITHIN an object function, you may use

   Instead of using the literal name of the base class in your
   code, you should be using the special name
   <literal>parent</literal>, which refers to the name of your

  <title>Serializing objects - objects in sessions</title>

  <note>
   <simpara>
    In PHP 3, objects will lose their class association
    throughout the process of serialization and unserialization. 
    The resulting variable is of type object, but has no class
    and no methods, thus it is pretty useless (it has become
    just like an array with a funny syntax).
   </simpara>
  </note>

  <caution>
   <simpara>
    The following information is valid for PHP 4 only. 
   </simpara>
  </caution>

  <para>
   <function>serialize</function> returns a string containing a
   byte-stream representation of any value that can be stored in
   PHP. <function>unserialize</function> can use this string to
   recreate the original variable values. Using serialize to
   save an object will save all variables in an object.  The
   functions in an object will not be saved, only the name of
   the class.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   In order to be able to <function>unserialize</function> an object, the
   class of that object needs to be defined. That is, if you have an object
   <varname>$a</varname> of class A on page1.php and serialize this, you'll
   get a string that refers to class A and contains all values of variabled
   contained in <varname>$a</varname>. If you want to be able to unserialize
   this on page2.php, recreating <varname>$a</varname> of class A, the
   definition of class A must be present in page2.php. This can be done for
   example by storing the class definition of class A in an include file and
   including this file in both page1.php and page2.php.

   If you are using sessions and use <function>session_register</function>
   to register objects, these objects are serialized automatically
   at the end of each PHP page, and are unserialized automatically on
   each of the following pages. This basically means that these objects
   can show up on any of your pages once they become part of your
   session.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   It is strongly recommended that you include the class
   definitions of all such registered objects on all of your
   pages, even if you do not actually use these classes on all
   of your pages. If you don't and an object is being
   unserialized without its class definition being present, it
   will lose its class association and become an object of class
   <literal>stdClass</literal> without any functions available
   at all, that is, it will become quite useless.
  </para>

   So if in the example above <varname>$a</varname> became part of a session

   the magic name <literal>__sleep</literal>. If so, that function is
   being run prior to any serialization. It can clean up the object
   and is supposed to return an array with the names of all variables
   of that object that should be serialized.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   The intended use of <literal>__sleep</literal> is to close any
   database connections that object may have, committing pending
   data or perform similar cleanup tasks. Also, the function is
   useful if you have very large objects which need not be
   saved completely.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   Conversely, <function>unserialize</function> checks for the
   presence of a function with the magic name 
   <literal>__wakeup</literal>. If present, this function can
   reconstruct any resources that object may have.
  </para>
  
  <para>
    The intended use of <literal>__wakeup</literal> is to
    reestablish any database connections that may have been lost
    during serialization and perform other reinitialization
    tasks.

    Creating references within the constructor can lead to confusing

   <para>
    Let us check out if there is a difference between
    <varname>$bar1</varname> which has been created using
    the copy <literal>=</literal> operator and
    <varname>$bar2</varname> which has been created using
    the reference <literal>=&amp;</literal> operator...

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$bar1 = new Foo('set in constructor');
$bar1->echoName();
$globalref[0]->echoName();

/* output:
set in constructor
set in constructor
set in constructor */

$bar2 =& new Foo('set in constructor');

     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    Apparently there is no difference, but in fact there is a
    very significant one: <varname>$bar1</varname> and
    <varname>$globalref[0]</varname> are _NOT_ referenced, they
    are NOT the same variable. This is because "new" does not
    return a reference by default, instead it returns a copy.
    <note>
     <simpara>
      There is no performance loss (since PHP 4 and up use reference
      counting) returning copies instead of references. On the
      contrary it is most often better to simply work with copies
      instead of references, because creating references takes some
      time where creating copies virtually takes no time (unless none
      of them is a large array or object and one of them gets changed
      and the other(s) one(s) subsequently, then it would be wise to
      use references to change them all concurrently).
     </simpara>
    </note>
    To prove what is written above let us watch the code below.

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// now we will change the name. what do you expect?
// you could expect that both $bar1 and $globalref[0] change their names...
$bar1->setName('set from outside');

// as mentioned before this is not the case.
$bar1->echoName();
$globalref[0]->echoName();

/* output:
set from outside
set in constructor */

// let us see what is different with $bar2 and $globalref[1]
$bar2->setName('set from outside');

// luckily they are not only equal, they are the same variable
// thus $bar2->name and $globalref[1]->name are the same too
$bar2->echoName();
$globalref[1]->echoName();

/* output:
set from outside
set from outside */

   <title>Comparing objects in PHP 4</title>
  <para>
   In PHP 4, objects are compared in a very simple manner, namely: Two object
   instances are equal if they have the same attributes and values, and are
   instances of the same class. Similar rules are applied when comparing two
   objects using the identity operator (<literal>===</literal>).

function bool2str($bool) {
    if ($bool === false) {
            return 'FALSE';
    } else {
            return 'TRUE';
    }
}

function compareObjects(&$o1, &$o2) {
    echo 'o1 == o2 : '.bool2str($o1 == $o2)."\n";

echo "\nCompare an instance of a parent class with one from a subclass\n";
compareObjects($o, $r);
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </example>
   We will see:
   <screen>
Compare instances created with the same parameters
o1 == o2 : TRUE
o1 != o2 : FALSE
o1 === o2 : TRUE
o1 !== o2 : FALSE

Compare instances created with different parameters
o1 == o2 : FALSE
o1 != o2 : TRUE
o1 === o2 : FALSE
o1 !== o2 : TRUE

Compare an instance of a parent class with one from a subclass
o1 == o2 : FALSE
o1 != o2 : TRUE
o1 === o2 : FALSE
o1 !== o2 : TRUE
   </screen>
   Which is the output we will expect to obtain given the comparison rules
   above. Only instances with the same values for their attributes and from the same
   class are considered equal and identical.
  </para>
  <para>
   Even in the cases where we have object composition, the same comparison
   rules apply. In the example below we create a container class that stores
   an associative array of <classname>Flag</classname> objects.
