  <title>Control Structures</title>

  <simpara>
   Any PHP script is built out of a series of statements. A statement
   can be an assignment, a function call, a loop, a conditional
   statement of even a statement that does nothing (an empty
   statement). Statements usually end with a semicolon. In addition,
   statements can be grouped into a statement-group by encapsulating a
   group of statements with curly braces. A statement-group is a
   statement by itself as well. The various statement types are
   described in this chapter.

  <sect1 id="control-structures.if">
   <title><literal>if</literal></title>
   <para>
    The <literal>if</literal> construct is one of the most important
    features of many languages, PHP included.  It allows for
    conditional execution of code fragments.  PHP features an
    <literal>if</literal> structure that is similar to that of C:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
if (expr)
    statement
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    As described in <link linkend="language.expressions">the section about
    expressions</link>, <replaceable>expr</replaceable> is evaluated to its
    Boolean value.  If <replaceable>expr</replaceable> evaluates to &true;,
   PHP will execute <replaceable>statement</replaceable>, and if it evaluates
    to &false; - it'll ignore it. More information about what values evaluate
    to &false; can be found in the <link
    linkend="language.types.boolean.casting">'Converting to boolean'</link>
    section.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    The following example would display <computeroutput>a is bigger
    than b</computeroutput> if <replaceable>$a</replaceable> is bigger
    than <replaceable>$b</replaceable>:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($a > $b)
    print "a is bigger than b";
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    Often you'd want to have more than one statement to be executed
    conditionally.  Of course, there's no need to wrap each statement
    with an <literal>if</literal> clause.  Instead, you can group
    several statements into a statement group.  For example, this code
    would display <computeroutput>a is bigger than b</computeroutput>
    if <replaceable>$a</replaceable> is bigger than
    <replaceable>$b</replaceable>, and would then assign the value of
    <replaceable>$a</replaceable> into <replaceable>$b</replaceable>:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($a > $b) {
    print "a is bigger than b";
    $b = $a;
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    <literal>If</literal> statements can be nested indefinitely within other
    <literal>if</literal> statements, which provides you with complete
    flexibility for conditional execution of the various parts of your
    program.
   </simpara>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.else">
   <title><literal>else</literal></title>
   <para>
    Often you'd want to execute a statement if a certain condition is
    met, and a different statement if the condition is not met.  This
    is what <literal>else</literal> is for.  <literal>else</literal>
    extends an <literal>if</literal> statement to execute a statement
    in case the expression in the <literal>if</literal> statement
    evaluates to &false;.  For example, the following
    code would display <computeroutput>a is bigger than
    b</computeroutput> if <replaceable>$a</replaceable> is bigger than
    <replaceable>$b</replaceable>, and <computeroutput>a is NOT bigger
    than b</computeroutput> otherwise:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($a > $b) {
    print "a is bigger than b";
} else {
    print "a is NOT bigger than b";
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    The <literal>else</literal> statement is only executed if the
    <literal>if</literal> expression evaluated to
    &false;, and if there were any
    <literal>elseif</literal> expressions - only if they evaluated to
    &false; as well (see <link
    linkend="control-structures.elseif">elseif</link>).

   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.elseif">
   <title><literal>elseif</literal></title>
   <para>
    <literal>elseif</literal>, as its name suggests, is a combination
    of <literal>if</literal> and <literal>else</literal>.  Like
    <literal>else</literal>, it extends an <literal>if</literal>
    statement to execute a different statement in case the original
    <literal>if</literal> expression evaluates to
    &false;.  However, unlike
    <literal>else</literal>, it will execute that alternative
    expression only if the <literal>elseif</literal> conditional
    expression evaluates to &true;.  For example, the
    following code would display <computeroutput>a is bigger than
    b</computeroutput>, <computeroutput>a equal to b</computeroutput>
    or <computeroutput>a is smaller than b</computeroutput>:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($a > $b) {
    print "a is bigger than b";
} elseif ($a == $b) {
    print "a is equal to b";
} else {
    print "a is smaller than b";
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    There may be several <literal>elseif</literal>s within the same
    <literal>if</literal> statement.  The first
    <literal>elseif</literal> expression (if any) that evaluates to
    &true; would be executed.  In PHP, you can also
    write 'else if' (in two words) and the behavior would be identical
    to the one of 'elseif' (in a single word).  The syntactic meaning
    is slightly different (if you're familiar with C, this is the same
    behavior) but the bottom line is that both would result in exactly
    the same behavior.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The <literal>elseif</literal> statement is only executed if the
    preceding <literal>if</literal> expression and any preceding
    <literal>elseif</literal> expressions evaluated to
    &false;, and the current
    <literal>elseif</literal> expression evaluated to
    &true;.
   </simpara>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.alternative-syntax">
   <title>Alternative syntax for control structures</title>
   <para>
    PHP offers an alternative syntax for some of its control
    structures; namely, <literal>if</literal>,
    <literal>while</literal>, <literal>for</literal>,
    <literal>foreach</literal>, and <literal>switch</literal>.
    In each case, the basic form of the alternate syntax is to change
    the opening brace to a colon (:) and the closing brace to
    <literal>endif;</literal>, <literal>endwhile;</literal>,
    <literal>endfor;</literal>, <literal>endforeach;</literal>, or
    <literal>endswitch;</literal>, respectively.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php if ($a == 5): ?>
A is equal to 5
<?php endif; ?>
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    In the above example, the HTML block "A is equal to 5" is nested within an
    <literal>if</literal> statement written in the alternative syntax.  The
    HTML block would be displayed only if $a is equal to 5.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    The alternative syntax applies to <literal>else</literal> and
    <literal>elseif</literal> as well.  The following is an
    <literal>if</literal> structure with <literal>elseif</literal> and
    <literal>else</literal> in the alternative format:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($a == 5):
    print "a equals 5";
    print "...";
elseif ($a == 6):
    print "a equals 6";
    print "!!!";
else:
    print "a is neither 5 nor 6";
endif;

  <sect1 id="control-structures.while">
   <title><literal>while</literal></title>
   <para>
    <literal>while</literal> loops are the simplest type of loop in
    PHP.  They behave just like their C counterparts.  The basic form
    of a <literal>while</literal> statement is:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
while (expr) statement
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    The meaning of a <literal>while</literal> statement is simple.  It
    tells PHP to execute the nested statement(s) repeatedly, as long
    as the <literal>while</literal> expression evaluates to
    &true;.  The value of the expression is checked
    each time at the beginning of the loop, so even if this value
    changes during the execution of the nested statement(s), execution
    will not stop until the end of the iteration (each time PHP runs
    the statements in the loop is one iteration).  Sometimes, if the
    <literal>while</literal> expression evaluates to
    &false; from the very beginning, the nested
    statement(s) won't even be run once.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    Like with the <literal>if</literal> statement, you can group
    multiple statements within the same <literal>while</literal> loop
    by surrounding a group of statements with curly braces, or by
    using the alternate syntax:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
while (expr): statement ... endwhile;
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    The following examples are identical, and both print numbers from
    1 to 10:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
/* example 1 */

$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10) {
    print $i++;  /* the printed value would be
                    $i before the increment
                    (post-increment) */
}

/* example 2 */

$i = 1;
while ($i <= 10):
    print $i;
    $i++;
endwhile;

    </informalexample>
   </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.do.while">
   <title><literal>do..while</literal></title>
   <simpara>
    <literal>do..while</literal> loops are very similar to
    <literal>while</literal> loops, except the truth expression is
    checked at the end of each iteration instead of in the beginning.
    The main difference from regular <literal>while</literal> loops is
    that the first iteration of a <literal>do..while</literal> loop is
    guaranteed to run (the truth expression is only checked at the end
    of the iteration), whereas it's may not necessarily run with a
    regular <literal>while</literal> loop (the truth expression is
    checked at the beginning of each iteration, if it evaluates to
    &false; right from the beginning, the loop
    execution would end immediately).
   </simpara>
   <para>
    There is just one syntax for <literal>do..while</literal> loops:

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
$i = 0;
do {
   print $i;
} while ($i>0);
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
     The above loop would run one time exactly, since after the first
     iteration, when truth expression is checked, it evaluates to
     &false; ($i is not bigger than 0) and the loop
     execution ends.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    Advanced C users may be familiar with a different usage of the
    <literal>do..while</literal> loop, to allow stopping execution in
    the middle of code blocks, by encapsulating them with
    <literal>do..while</literal>(0), and using the <link
    linkend="control-structures.break"><literal>break</literal></link>
    statement.  The following code fragment demonstrates this:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
do {
    if ($i < 5) {
        print "i is not big enough";
        break;
    }
    $i *= $factor;
    if ($i < $minimum_limit) {
        break;
    }
    print "i is ok";

     ...process i...

} while(0);
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    Don't worry if you don't understand this right away or at all.
    You can code scripts and even powerful scripts without using this
    'feature'.

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.for">
   <title><literal>for</literal></title>
   <para>
    <literal>for</literal> loops are the most complex loops in PHP.
    They behave like their C counterparts.  The syntax of a
    <literal>for</literal> loop is:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
for (expr1; expr2; expr3) statement
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    The first expression (<replaceable>expr1</replaceable>) is
    evaluated (executed) once unconditionally at the beginning of the
    loop.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    In the beginning of each iteration,
    <replaceable>expr2</replaceable> is evaluated.  If it evaluates to
    &true;, the loop continues and the nested
    statement(s) are executed.  If it evaluates to
    &false;, the execution of the loop ends.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    At the end of each iteration, <replaceable>expr3</replaceable> is
    evaluated (executed).
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Each of the expressions can be empty.
    <replaceable>expr2</replaceable> being empty means the loop should
    be run indefinitely (PHP implicitly considers it as
    &true;, like C).  This may not be as useless as
    you might think, since often you'd want to end the loop using a
    conditional <link
    linkend="control-structures.break"><literal>break</literal></link>
    statement instead of using the <literal>for</literal> truth
    expression.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    Consider the following examples.  All of them display numbers from
    1 to 10:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
/* example 1 */

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    print $i;
}

/* example 2 */

for ($i = 1;;$i++) {
    if ($i > 10) {
        break;
    }
    print $i;
}

/* example 3 */

$i = 1;
for (;;) {
    if ($i > 10) {
        break;
    }
    print $i;
    $i++;
}

/* example 4 */

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; print $i, $i++);
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    Of course, the first example appears to be the nicest one (or
    perhaps the fourth), but you may find that being able to use empty
    expressions in <literal>for</literal> loops comes in handy in many
    occasions.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    PHP also supports the alternate "colon syntax" for
    <literal>for</literal> loops.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
for (expr1; expr2; expr3): statement; ...; endfor;
]]>
     </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    Other languages have a <literal>foreach</literal> statement to
    traverse an array or hash. PHP 3 has no such construct; PHP 4 does
    (see <link
    linkend="control-structures.foreach">foreach</link>). In PHP 3, you
    can combine <link linkend="control-structures.while">while</link>
    with the <function>list</function> and <function>each</function>
    functions to achieve the same effect. See the documentation for
    these functions for an example.
   </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="control-structures.foreach">
   <title><literal>foreach</literal></title>
   <para>
    PHP 4 (not PHP 3) includes a <literal>foreach</literal> construct, much
    like Perl and some other languages. This simply gives an easy way to
    iterate over arrays. <literal>foreach</literal> works only on arrays, and
    will issue an error when you try to use it on a variable with a different
    data type or an uninitialized variables. There are two syntaxes; the
    second is a minor but useful extension of the first:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
foreach(array_expression as $value) statement
foreach(array_expression as $key => $value) statement
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    The first form loops over the array given by
    <literal>array_expression</literal>. On each loop, the value of
    the current element is assigned to <literal>$value</literal> and
    the internal array pointer is advanced by one (so on the next
    loop, you'll be looking at the next element).
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The second form does the same thing, except that the current
    element's key will be assigned to the variable
    <literal>$key</literal> on each loop.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    <note>
     <para>
      When <literal>foreach</literal> first starts executing, the
      internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element
      of the array. This means that you do not need to call
      <function>reset</function> before a <literal>foreach</literal>
      loop.
     </para>
    </note>
   </para>
   <para>
    <note>
     <para>
      Also note that <literal>foreach</literal> operates on a copy of
      the specified array, not the array itself, therefore the array
      pointer is not modified as with the <function>each</function>
      construct and changes to the array element returned are not
      reflected in the original array.  However, the internal pointer
      of the original array <emphasis>is</emphasis> advanced with
      the processing of the array.  Assuming the foreach loop runs
      to completion, the array's internal pointer will be at the
      end of the array.
     </para>
    </note>
   </para>
   <note>
    <para>
     <literal>foreach</literal> does not support the ability to
     suppress error messages using '@'.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    You may have noticed that the following are functionally
    identical:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">

$arr = array("one", "two", "three");
reset ($arr);
while (list(, $value) = each ($arr)) {

    echo "Value: $value<br>\n";

    The following are also functionally identical:

   <simpara>
    The <literal>switch</literal> statement is similar to a series of
    IF statements on the same expression.  In many occasions, you may
    want to compare the same variable (or expression) with many
    different values, and execute a different piece of code depending
    on which value it equals to.  This is exactly what the
    <literal>switch</literal> statement is for.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    The following two examples are two different ways to write the
    same thing, one using a series of <literal>if</literal>
    statements, and the other using the <literal>switch</literal>
    statement:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
if ($i == 0) {
    print "i equals 0";
} elseif ($i == 1) {
    print "i equals 1";
} elseif ($i == 2) {
    print "i equals 2";
}

switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        print "i equals 0";
        break;
    case 1:
        print "i equals 1";
        break;
    case 2:
        print "i equals 2";
        break;
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    It is important to understand how the <literal>switch</literal>
    statement is executed in order to avoid mistakes.  The
    <literal>switch</literal> statement executes line by line
    (actually, statement by statement).  In the beginning, no code is
    executed.  Only when a <literal>case</literal> statement is found
    with a value that matches the value of the
    <literal>switch</literal> expression does PHP begin to execute the
    statements.  PHP continues to execute the statements until the end
    of the <literal>switch</literal> block, or the first time it sees
    a <literal>break</literal> statement.  If you don't write a
    <literal>break</literal> statement at the end of a case's
    statement list, PHP will go on executing the statements of the
    following case.  For example:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        print "i equals 0";
    case 1:
        print "i equals 1";
    case 2:
        print "i equals 2";
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    Here, if $i is equal to 0, PHP would execute all of the print
    statements!  If $i is equal to 1, PHP would execute the last two
    print statements. You would get the expected behavior ('i equals 2' 
    would be displayed) only if $i is equal to 2.  Thus,
    it is important not to forget <literal>break</literal> statements
    (even though you may want to avoid supplying them on purpose under
    certain circumstances).
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    In a <literal>switch</literal> statement, the condition is
    evaluated only once and the result is compared to each
    <literal>case</literal> statement. In an <literal>elseif</literal>
    statement, the condition is evaluated again. If your condition is
    more complicated than a simple compare and/or is in a tight loop,
    a <literal>switch</literal> may be faster.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    The statement list for a case can also be empty, which simply
    passes control into the statement list for the next case.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
    case 1:
    case 2:
        print "i is less than 3 but not negative";
        break;
    case 3:
        print "i is 3";
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    A special case is the default case.  This case matches anything
    that wasn't matched by the other cases, and should be the last
    <literal>case</literal> statement.  For example:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
switch ($i) {
    case 0:
        print "i equals 0";
        break;
    case 1:
        print "i equals 1";
        break;
    case 2:
        print "i equals 2";
        break;
    default:
        print "i is not equal to 0, 1 or 2";
}
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    The <literal>case</literal> expression may be any expression that
    evaluates to a simple type, that is, integer or floating-point
    numbers and strings.  Arrays or objects cannot be used here unless
    they are dereferenced to a simple type.

   <para>
    The <literal>statement</literal> part of the

    The example profiles the PHP code within the 'declare'
    block, recording the time at which every second low-level
    statement in the block was executed. This information can
    then be used to find the slow areas within particular
    segments of code. This process can be performed using other
    methods: using ticks is more convenient and easier to

   <simpara>
    If called from within a function, the <function>return</function>
    statement immediately ends execution of the current function, and
    returns its argument as the value of the function
    call. <function>return</function> will also end the execution of
    an <function>eval</function> statement or script file.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    If called from the global scope, then execution of the current
    script file is ended. If the current script file was
    <function>include</function>ed or <function>require</function>ed,
    then control is passed back to the calling file. Furthermore, if
    the current script file was <function>include</function>ed, then
    the value given to <function>return</function> will be returned as
    the value of the <function>include</function> call. If
    <function>return</function> is called from within the main script
    file, then script execution ends. If the current script file was
    named by the <link

    linkend="ini.auto-append-file">auto_append_file</link>
    configuration options in &php.ini;,

     Prior to PHP 4.0.2, the following applies: <function>require</function> will 
     always attempt to read the target file, even if the line it's on never executes.
     The conditional statement won't affect <function>require</function>. However, 
     if the line on which the <function>require</function> occurs is not executed, 
     neither will any of the code in the target file be executed.  Similarly, looping 
     structures do not affect the behaviour of <function>require</function>. Although 
     the code contained in the target file is still subject to the loop, the 
     <function>require</function> itself happens only once.

     When a file is included, parsing drops out of PHP mode and

     other supported wrapper - see <xref linkend="wrappers"/> for a list
     of protocols) instead of a local pathname.  If the target server interprets
     the target file as PHP code, variables may be passed to the included
     file using an URL request string as used with HTTP GET.  This is
     not strictly speaking the same thing as including the file and having
     it inherit the parent file's variable scope; the script is actually
     being run on the remote server and the result is then being

    included exactly once to avoid problems with function redefinitions,
    variable value reassignments, etc.

     Be aware, that the behaviour of <function>include_once</function>
     and <function>require_once</function> may not be what you expect
     on a non case sensitive operating system (such as Windows).
     <example>
      <title><function>include_once</function> is case sensitive</title>
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
include_once("a.php"); // this will include a.php
include_once("A.php"); // this will include a.php again on Windows!
]]>
       </programlisting>
