  <title>Constants</title>

  <simpara>
   A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name
   suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the
   script (except for <link linkend="language.constants.predefined">
   magic constants</link>, which aren't actually constants).
   A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant 
   identifiers are always uppercase.
  </simpara>
  <para>
   The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A 
   valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed
   by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular
   expression, it would be expressed thusly:
   <literal>[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*</literal>

   <!-- TODO: Example of valid & invalid constant names -->
  </para>
  <note>
   <simpara>
    For our purposes here, a letter is a-z, A-Z, and the ASCII
    characters from 127 through 255 (0x7f-0xff).
   </simpara>
  </note>

  <simpara>
   Like &link.superglobals;, the scope of a constant is global.  You 
   can access constants anywhere in your script without regard to scope.  
   For more information on scope, read the manual section on
   <link linkend="language.variables.scope">variable scope</link>.
  </simpara>

   <simpara>
    You can define a constant by using the 
    <function>define</function>-function. Once a constant is defined,
    it can never be changed or undefined.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Only scalar data (<type>boolean</type>, <type>integer</type>, 
    <type>float</type> and <type>string</type>) can be contained 
    in constants.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    You can get the value of a constant by simply specifying its name.
    Unlike with variables, you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> prepend
    a constant with a <literal>$</literal>.
    You can also use the function <function>constant</function> to
    read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name
    dynamically. 
    Use <function>get_defined_constants</function> to get a list of 
    all defined constants.
   </simpara>
   <note>
    <simpara>
     Constants and (global) variables are in a different namespace. 
     This implies that for example &true; and 
     <varname>$TRUE</varname> are generally different.
    </simpara>
   </note>
   <simpara>
    If you use an undefined constant, PHP assumes that you mean
    the name of the constant itself, just as if you called it as
    a <type>string</type> (CONSTANT vs "CONSTANT").  An error of level
    <link linkend="ref.errorfunc">E_NOTICE</link> will be issued
    when this happens.  See also the manual entry on why 
    <link linkend="language.types.array.foo-bar">$foo[bar]</link> is
    wrong (unless you first <function>define</function>
    <literal>bar</literal> as a constant).  If you simply want to check if a
    constant is set, use the <function>defined</function> function.

     <listitem>
      <simpara>

   <simpara>
    PHP provides a large number of predefined constants to any script
    which it runs. Many of these constants, however, are created by
    various extensions, and will only be present when those extensions
    are available, either via dynamic loading or because they have
    been compiled in.
   </simpara>
   
   <para>
    There are five magical constants that change depending on
    where they are used.  For example, the value of
    <constant>__LINE__</constant> depends on the line that it's
    used on in your script. These special constants are 
    case-insensitive and are as follows:
