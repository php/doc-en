  <title>Constants</title>

  <simpara>
   A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name
   suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the
   script (except for <link linkend="language.constants.predefined">
   magic constants</link>, which aren't actually constants).
   A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant 
   identifiers are always uppercase.
  </simpara>
  <para>
   The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A 
   valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed
   by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular
   expression, it would be expressed thusly:
   <literal>[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*</literal>

    For our purposes here, a letter is a-z, A-Z, and the ASCII
    characters from 127 through 255 (0x7f-0xff).

   Like &link.superglobals;, the scope of a constant is global.  You 
   can access constants anywhere in your script without regard to scope.  
   For more information on scope, read the manual section on
   <link linkend="language.variables.scope">variable scope</link>.
  </simpara>

   <title>Syntax</title>
   <simpara>
    You can define a constant by using the 
    <function>define</function>-function or by using the 
    <literal>const</literal> keyword outside a class definition as 
    of PHP 5.3.0. Once a constant is defined, it can never be 
    changed or undefined.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Only scalar data (<type>boolean</type>, <type>integer</type>, 
    <type>float</type> and <type>string</type>) can be contained 
    in constants. It is possible to define constants as a 
    <type>resource</type>, but it should be avoided, as it can cause 
    unexpected results.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    You can get the value of a constant by simply specifying its name.
    Unlike with variables, you should <emphasis>not</emphasis> prepend
    a constant with a <literal>$</literal>.
    You can also use the function <function>constant</function> to
    read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name
    dynamically. 
    Use <function>get_defined_constants</function> to get a list of 
    all defined constants.
   </simpara>
   <note>
    <simpara>
     Constants and (global) variables are in a different namespace. 
     This implies that for example &true; and 
     <varname>$TRUE</varname> are generally different.
    </simpara>
   </note>
   <simpara>
    If you use an undefined constant, PHP assumes that you mean
    the name of the constant itself, just as if you called it as
    a <type>string</type> (CONSTANT vs "CONSTANT").  An error of level
    <link linkend="ref.errorfunc">E_NOTICE</link> will be issued
    when this happens.  See also the manual entry on why 
    <link linkend="language.types.array.foo-bar">$foo[bar]</link> is
    wrong (unless you first <function>define</function>
    <literal>bar</literal> as a constant).  If you simply want to check if a
    constant is set, use the <function>defined</function> function.

    These are the differences between constants and variables:

   <note>
    <para>
     As opposed to defining constants using <function>define</function>,
     constants defined using the <literal>const</literal> keyword must be
     declared at the top-level scope because they are defined at compile-time.
     This means that they cannot be declared inside functions, loops or
     <literal>if</literal> statements.

   <title>Magic constants</title>

   <simpara>
    PHP provides a large number of <link
    linkend="reserved.constants">predefined constants</link> to any script
    which it runs. Many of these constants, however, are created by
    various extensions, and will only be present when those extensions
    are available, either via dynamic loading or because they have
    been compiled in.
   </simpara>
   
   <para>
    There are seven magical constants that change depending on
    where they are used.  For example, the value of
    <constant>__LINE__</constant> depends on the line that it's
    used on in your script. These special constants are 
    case-insensitive and are as follows:

   <para>
    <table>
     <title>A few "magical" PHP constants</title>
     <tgroup cols="2">
      <thead>
       <row>
        <entry>Name</entry>
        <entry>Description</entry>
       </row>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__LINE__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The current line number of the file.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__FILE__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The full path and filename of the file.  If used inside an include,
         the name of the included file is returned.
         Since PHP 4.0.2, <constant>__FILE__</constant> always contains an
         absolute path with symlinks resolved whereas in older versions it contained relative path
         under some circumstances.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__DIR__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The directory of the file.  If used inside an include,
         the directory of the included file is returned. This is equivalent
         to <literal>dirname(__FILE__)</literal>. This directory name
         does not have a trailing slash unless it is the root directory.
         (Added in PHP 5.3.0.)
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__FUNCTION__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The function name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0)  As of PHP 5 this constant 
         returns the function name as it was declared (case-sensitive).  In
         PHP 4 its value is always lowercased.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__CLASS__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The class name. (Added in PHP 4.3.0)  As of PHP 5 this constant 
         returns the class name as it was declared (case-sensitive).  In PHP
         4 its value is always lowercased.  The class name includes the namespace
         it was declared in (e.g. <literal>Foo\Bar</literal>).
         Note that as of PHP 5.4 __CLASS__ works also in traits. When used
         in a trait method, __CLASS__ is the name of the class the trait
         is used in.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__TRAIT__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The trait name. (Added in PHP 5.4.0)  As of PHP 5.4 this constant 
         returns the trait as it was declared (case-sensitive).  The trait name includes the namespace
         it was declared in (e.g. <literal>Foo\Bar</literal>).
        </entry>
       </row>
       
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__METHOD__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The class method name. (Added in PHP 5.0.0)  The method name is
         returned as it was declared (case-sensitive).
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry><constant>__NAMESPACE__</constant></entry>
        <entry>
         The name of the current namespace (case-sensitive). This constant 
         is defined in compile-time (Added in PHP 5.3.0).
