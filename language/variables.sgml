   <para>
    Variables in PHP are represented by a dollar sign followed by the
    name of the variable. The variable name is case-sensitive.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php"> 
$var = "Bob";
$Var = "Joe";
echo "$var, $Var"; // outputs "Bob, Joe"
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    In PHP3, variables are always assigned by value. That is to say,
    when you assign an expression to a variable, the entire value of
    the original expression is copied into the destination
    variable. This means, for instance, that after assigning one
    variable's value to another, changing one of those variables will
    have no effect on the other. For more information on this kind of
    assignment, see <link
    linkend="language.expressions">Expressions</link>.
   </para>
   <para>
    PHP4 offers another way to assign values to variables:
    <emphasis>assign by reference</emphasis>. This means that the new
    variable simply references (in other words, "becomes an alias for"
    or "points to") the original variable. Changes to the new variable
    affect the original, and vice versa. This also means that no
    copying is performed; thus, the assignment happens more
    quickly. However, any speedup will likely be noticed only in tight
    loops or when assigning large arrays or objects.
   </para>
   <para>
    To assign by reference, simply prepend an ampersand (&amp;) to the
    beginning of the variable which is being assigned (the source
    variable). For instance, the following code snippet outputs 'My
    name is Bob' twice:

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
&lt;?php
$foo = 'Bob';              // Assign the value 'Bob' to $foo
$bar = &amp;$foo;              // Reference $foo via $bar.
$bar = "My name is $bar";  // Alter $bar...
echo $foo;                 // $foo is altered too.
echo $bar;
?&gt;
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    One important thing to note is that only named variables may be
    assigned by reference.
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
&lt;?php
$foo = 25;
$bar = &amp;$foo;      // This is a valid assignment.
$bar = &amp;(24 * 7);  // Invalid; references an unnamed expression.

function test() {
   return 25;
}

$bar = &amp;test();    // Invalid.
?&gt;
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

   <title>Predefined variables</title>
   
   <simpara>
    PHP provides a large number of predefined variables to any script
    which it runs. Many of these variables, however, cannot be fully
    documented as they are dependent upon which server is running, the
    version and setup of the server, and other factors. Some of these
    variables will not be available when PHP is run on the
    command-line.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Despite these factors, here is a list of predefined variables
    available under a stock installation of PHP 3 running as a module
    under a stock installation of <ulink
    url="&url.apache;">Apache</ulink> 1.3.6.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    For a list of all predefined variables (and lots of other useful
    information), please see (and use) <function>phpinfo</function>.
   </simpara>

   <note>
    <simpara>
     This list is neither exhaustive nor intended to be. It is simply
     a guideline as to what sorts of predefined variables you can
     expect to have access to in your script.
    </simpara>
   </note>

   <sect2 id="language.variables.predefined.apache">
    <title>Apache variables</title>

    <simpara>
     These variables are created by the <ulink
     url="&url.apache;">Apache</ulink> webserver. If you are running
     another webserver, there is no guarantee that it will provide the
     same variables; it may omit some, or provide others not listed
     here. That said, a large number of these variables are accounted
     for in the <ulink url="&url.cgispec;">CGI 1.1
     specification</ulink>, so you should be able to expect those.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     Note that few, if any, of these will be available (or indeed have
     any meaning) if running PHP on the command line.

  <sect1 id="language.variables.scope">
   <title>Variable scope</title>

   <simpara>
    The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined.
    For the most part all PHP variables only have a single scope.
    This single scope spans included and required files as well.  For
    example:
   </simpara>
   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
$a = 1;
include "b.inc";
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>
   <simpara>
    Here the $a variable will be available within the included b.inc
    script.  However, within user-defined functions a local function
    scope is introduced.  Any variable used inside a function is by
    default limited to the local function scope.  For
    example:
   </simpara>
    
   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php"> 
$a = 1; /* global scope */ 

Function Test () { 
    echo $a; /* reference to local scope variable */ 
} 

Test ();
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    This script will not produce any output because the echo statement
    refers to a local version of the $a variable, and it has not been
    assigned a value within this scope.  You may notice that this is a
    little bit different from the C language in that global variables
    in C are automatically available to functions unless specifically
    overridden by a local definition.  This can cause some problems in
    that people may inadvertently change a global variable.  In PHP
    global variables must be declared global inside a function if they
    are going to be used in that function.  An example:</simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
$a = 1;
$b = 2;

Function Sum () {
    global $a, $b;

    $b = $a + $b;
} 

Sum ();
echo $b;
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    The above script will output &quot;3&quot;.  By declaring $a and
    $b global within the function, all references to either variable
    will refer to the global version.  There is no limit to the number
    of global variables that can be manipulated by a
    function.
   </simpara>

   <simpara>
    A second way to access variables from the global scope is to use
    the special PHP-defined $GLOBALS array.  The previous example can
    be rewritten as:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
$a = 1;
$b = 2;

Function Sum () {
    $GLOBALS["b"] = $GLOBALS["a"] + $GLOBALS["b"];
} 

Sum ();
echo $b;
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    The $GLOBALS array is an associative array with the name of the
    global variable being the key and the contents of that variable
    being the value of the array element.
   </simpara>

   <simpara>
    Another important feature of variable scoping is the
    <emphasis>static</emphasis> variable.  A static variable exists
    only in a local function scope, but it does not lose its value
    when program execution leaves this scope.  Consider the following
    example:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
Function Test () {
    $a = 0;
    echo $a;
    $a++;
}
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    This function is quite useless since every time it is called it
    sets $a to 0 and prints &quot;0&quot;.  The $a++ which increments
    the variable serves no purpose since as soon as the function exits
    the $a variable disappears.  To make a useful counting function
    which will not lose track of the current count, the $a variable is
    declared static:</simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
Function Test () {
    static $a = 0;
    echo $a;
    $a++;
}
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    Now, every time the Test() function is called it will print the
    value of $a and increment it.
   </simpara>

   <simpara>
    Static variables also provide one way to deal with recursive
    functions. A recursive function is one which calls itself.  Care
    must be taken when writing a recursive function because it is
    possible to make it recurse indefinitely.  You must make sure you
    have an adequate way of terminating the recursion.  The following
    simple function recursively counts to 10, using the static
    variable $count to know when to stop:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
Function Test () {
    static $count = 0;

    $count++;
    echo $count;
    if ($count < 10) {
        Test ();
    }
    $count--;
}
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="language.variables.variable">
   <title>Variable variables</title>

   <simpara>
    Sometimes it is convenient to be able to have variable variable
    names.  That is, a variable name which can be set and used
    dynamically.  A normal variable is set with a statement such as:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
$a = "hello";
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    A variable variable takes the value of a variable and treats that
    as the name of a variable.  In the above example,
    <emphasis>hello</emphasis>, can be used as the name of a variable
    by using two dollar signs. i.e.
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
$$a = "world";
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    At this point two variables have been defined and stored in the
    PHP symbol tree: $a with contents "hello" and $hello with contents
    "world".  Therefore, this statement:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting role="php">
echo "$a ${$a}";
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
    produces the exact same output as:
   </simpara>

   <informalexample>
    <programlisting>
echo "$a $hello";
    </programlisting>
   </informalexample>

   <simpara>
     i.e. they both produce: <emphasis>hello world</emphasis>.
   </simpara>

   <simpara>
    In order to use variable variables with arrays, you have to
    resolve an ambiguity problem.  That is, if you write $$a[1] then
    the parser needs to know if you meant to use $a[1] as a variable,
    or if you wanted $$a as the variable and then the [1] index from
    that variable.  The syntax for resolving this ambiguity is:
    ${$a[1]} for the first case and ${$a}[1] for the
    second.
   </simpara>

     When a form is submitted to a PHP script, any variables from that

    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="name">&lt;br>
    &lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>
      </programlisting>
     </example>
    </para>

    <simpara>
     When submitted, PHP will create the variable
     <computeroutput>$name</computeroutput>, which will will contain
     whatever what entered into the <emphasis>Name:</emphasis> field
     on the form.
    </simpara>

    <simpara>
     PHP also understands arrays in the context of form variables, but
     only in one dimension. You may, for example, group related
     variables together, or use this feature to retrieve values from a
     multiple select input:</simpara>

    <para>
     <example>
      <title>More complex form variables</title>
      <programlisting role="php">
&lt;form action="array.php" method="post">
    Name: &lt;input type="text" name="personal[name]">&lt;br>
    Email: &lt;input type="text" name="personal[email]">&lt;br>
    Beer: &lt;br>
    &lt;select multiple name="beer[]">
        &lt;option value="warthog">Warthog
        &lt;option value="guinness">Guinness
        &lt;option value="stuttgarter">Stuttgarter Schwabenbräu
        &lt;/select>
    &lt;input type="submit">
&lt;/form>
      </programlisting>
     </example>
    </para>

    <simpara>
     If PHP's track_vars feature is turned on, either by the <link
     linkend="ini.track-vars">track_vars</link> configuration setting
     or the <computeroutput>&lt;?php_track_vars?&gt;</computeroutput>
     directive, then variables submitted via the POST or GET methods
     will also be found in the global associative arrays
     $HTTP_POST_VARS and $HTTP_GET_VARS as appropriate.
    </simpara>

    <sect3>
     <title>IMAGE SUBMIT variable names</title>

     <simpara>
      When submitting a form, it is possible to use an image instead
      of the standard submit button with a tag like:</simpara>

     <informalexample>
      <programlisting role="php">
&lt;input type=image src="image.gif" name="sub">
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>

     <simpara>
      When the user clicks somewhere on the image, the accompanying
      form will be transmitted to the server with two additional
      variables, sub_x and sub_y. These contain the coordinates of the
      user click within the image.  The experienced may note that the
      actual variable names sent by the browser contains a period
      rather than an underscore, but PHP converts the period to an
      underscore automatically.
     </simpara>
    </sect3>

   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="language.variables.external.cookies">
    <title>HTTP Cookies</title>

    <simpara>
     PHP transparently supports HTTP cookies as defined by <ulink
     url="&spec.cookies;">Netscape's Spec</ulink>.  Cookies are a
     mechanism for storing data in the remote browser and thus
     tracking or identifying return users.  You can set cookies using
     the <function>SetCookie</function> function.  Cookies are part of
     the HTTP header, so the SetCookie function must be called before
     any output is sent to the browser.  This is the same restriction
     as for the <function>Header</function> function.  Any cookies
     sent to you from the client will automatically be turned into a
     PHP variable just like GET and POST method data.</simpara>

    <simpara>
     If you wish to assign multiple values to a single cookie, just
     add <emphasis>[]</emphasis> to the cookie name.  For
     example:
    </simpara>

    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="php">
SetCookie ("MyCookie[]", "Testing", time()+3600);
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>

    <simpara>
     Note that a cookie will replace a previous cookie by the same
     name in your browser unless the path or domain is different.  So,
     for a shopping cart application you may want to keep a counter
     and pass this along.  i.e.
    </simpara>

    <example>
     <title>SetCookie Example</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
$Count++;
SetCookie ("Count", $Count, time()+3600);
SetCookie ("Cart[$Count]", $item, time()+3600);
     </programlisting>
    </example>

   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="language.variables.external.environment">
    <title>Environment variables</title>

    <para>
     PHP automatically makes environment variables available as normal
     PHP variables.
     
     <informalexample>
      <programlisting role="php">
echo $HOME;  /* Shows the HOME environment variable, if set. */
      </programlisting>
     </informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
     Since information coming in via GET, POST and Cookie mechanisms
     also automatically create PHP variables, it is sometimes best to
     explicitly read a variable from the environment in order to make
     sure that you are getting the right version.  The
     <function>getenv</function> function can be used for this.  You
     can also set an environment variable with the
     <function>putenv</function> function.
    </para>
   </sect2>

   <sect2>
    <title>Dots in incoming variable names</title>

    <para>
     Typically, PHP does not alter the names of variables when they
     are passed into a script. However, it should be noted that the
     dot (period, full stop) is not a valid character in a PHP
     variable name. For the reason, look at it:
     <programlisting role="php">
$varname.ext;  /* invalid variable name */
     </programlisting>
     Now, what the parser sees is a variable named $varname, followed
     by the string concatenation operator, followed by the barestring
     (i.e. unquoted string which doesn't match any known key or
     reserved words) 'ext'. Obviously, this doesn't have the intended
     result.
    </para>

    <para>
     For this reason, it is important to note that PHP will
     automatically replace any dots in incoming variable names with
     underscores.
    </para>

    <title>Determining variable types</title>

    <para>
     Because PHP determines the types of variables and converts them
     (generally) as needed, it is not always obvious what type a given
     variable is at any one time.  PHP includes several functions
     which find out what type a variable is. They are
     <function>gettype</function>, <function>is_long</function>,
     <function>is_double</function>, <function>is_string</function>,
     <function>is_array</function>, and
     <function>is_object</function>.
