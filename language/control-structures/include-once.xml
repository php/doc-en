 <para>
  The <literal>include_once</literal> expression includes and evaluates
  the specified file during the execution of the script.
  This is a behavior similar to the <function>include</function> expression,
  with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already
  been included, it will not be included again, and include_once returns &true;.  As the name suggests,
  the file will be included just once.
 </para>
 <para>
  <literal>include_once</literal> may be used in cases where
  the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a
  particular execution of a script, so in this case it may help avoid
  problems such as function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc.
 </para>
 <para>
  See the <function>include</function> documentation for information about
  how this function works.
