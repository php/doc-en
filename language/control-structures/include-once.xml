 <para>
  The <function>include_once</function> statement includes and evaluates
  the specified file during the execution of the script.
  This is a behavior similar to the <function>include</function> statement,
  with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already
  been included, it will not be included again.  As the name suggests,
  it will be included just once.
 </para>
 <para>
  <function>include_once</function> may be used in cases where
  the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a
  particular execution of a script, so in this case it may help avoid
  problems such as function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc.
 </para>
 <para>
  See the <function>include</function> documentation for information about
  how this function works.

  <note>
  <para>
   With PHP 4, <literal>_once</literal> functionality differs with case-insensitive
   operating systems (like Windows) so for example:
   <example>
    <title><function>include_once</function> with a case insensitive OS in PHP 4</title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
include_once "a.php"; // this will include a.php
include_once "A.php"; // this will include a.php again! (PHP 4 only)
?>
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </example>
   </para>
   <para>
    This behaviour changed in PHP 5, so for example with Windows the path is normalized first so that
    <filename>C:\PROGRA~1\A.php</filename> is realized the same as
    <filename>C:\Program Files\a.php</filename> and the file is included just once.
