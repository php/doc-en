 <para>
  A &finally; block may also be specified after or instead of &catch; blocks.
  Code within the &finally; block will always be executed after the &try; and
  &catch; blocks, regardless of whether a <classname>Throwable</classname> error
  has been thrown, and before normal execution resumes.

 <para>
  When the call stack is unwound after a <classname>Throwable</classname> error
  has been thrown, all &finally; blocks it encounters along the way will be executed.
  In other words, nested &finally; blocks are executed even if the
  <classname>Throwable</classname> error is not caught by an adjacent
  &catch; block.

  <title>Interaction between a &finally; block and a &return; statement</title>
  <para>
   One notable interaction is between the &finally; block and a &return; statement.
   If a &return; statement is encountered inside either the &try; or the &catch; blocks,
   the &finally; block will still be executed. Moreover, the &return; statement is
   evaluated when encountered, but the result will be returned after the &finally; block
   is executed. Additionally, if the &finally; block also contains a &return; statement,
   the value from the &finally; block is returned.
