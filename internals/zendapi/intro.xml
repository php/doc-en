  Sometimes, PHP "as is" simply isn't enough. Although these cases are rare
  for the average user, professional applications will soon lead PHP to the edge
  of its capabilities, in terms of either speed or functionality. New
  functionality cannot always be implemented natively due to language
  restrictions and inconveniences that arise when having to carry around a huge
  library of default code appended to every single script, so another method
  needs to be found for overcoming these eventual lacks in PHP.

  As soon as this point is reached, it's time to touch the heart of PHP
  and take a look at its core, the C code that makes PHP go.
