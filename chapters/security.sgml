  <title>Security</title>

  <simpara>
   PHP is a powerful language and the interpreter, whether included
   in a web server as a module or executed as a separate
   <acronym>CGI</acronym> binary, is able to access files, execute
   commands and open network connections on the server.  These
   properties make anything run on a web server insecure by default.
   PHP is designed specifically to be a more secure language for
   writing CGI programs than Perl or C, and with correct selection of
   compile-time and runtime configuration options it gives you
   exactly the combination of freedom and security you need.

  <simpara>
   As there are many different ways of utilizing PHP, there are many
   configuration options controlling its behaviour.  A large
   selection of options guarantees you can use PHP for a lot of
   purposes, but it also means there are combinations of these
   options and server configurations that result in an insecure
   setup.  This chapter explains the different configuration option
   combinations and the situations they can be safely used.

    <title>Possible attacks</title>

    <simpara>
     Using PHP as a <acronym>CGI</acronym> binary is an option for
      setups that for some reason do not wish to integrate PHP as a
      module into server software (like Apache), or will use PHP with
      different kinds of CGI wrappers to create safe chroot and setuid
      environments for scripts.  This setup usually involves
      installing executable PHP binary to the web server cgi-bin
      directory.  CERT advisory <ulink
      url="http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-96.11.interpreters_in_cgi_bin_dir.html">CA-96.11</ulink>
      recommends agains placing any interpreters into cgi-bin.  Even
      if the PHP binary can be used as a standalone interpreter, PHP
      is designed to prevent the attacks this setup makes possible:

     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><simpara>Accessing system files:
        <filename role=url>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php?/etc/passwd</filename>

       <simpara>
        The query information in an url after the question mark (?)
	is passed as command line arguments to the interpreter by the
	CGI interface.  Usually interpreters open and execute the
	file specified as the first argument on the command line.

       <simpara>
        When invoked as a CGI binary, PHP refuses to interpret the
	command	line arguments.
       </simpara></listitem>
      <listitem><simpara>Accessing any web document on server:
	<filename
	 role=url>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/secret/doc.html</filename>

       <simpara>
	The path information part of the url after the PHP binary
	name, <filename role=uri>/secret/doc.html</filename> is
	conventionally used to specify the name of the file to be
	opened and interpreted by the <acronym>CGI</acronym> program.
	Usually some web server configuration directives (Apache:
	Action) are used to redirect requests to documents like
	<filename
	role=url>http://my.host/secret/script.php3</filename> to the
	PHP interpreter.  With this setup, the web server first checks
	the access permissions to the directory <filename
	role=uri>/secret</filename>, and after that creates the
	redirected request <filename
	role=url>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/secret/script.php3</filename>.
	Unfortunately, if the request is originally given in this
	form, no access checks are made by web server for file
	<filename role=uri>/secret/script.php3</filename>, but only
	for the <filename role=uri>/cgi-bin/php</filename> file.  This
	way any user able to access <filename
	role=uri>/cgi-bin/php</filename> is able to access any
	protected document on the web server.

       <simpara>
	In PHP, compile-time configuration option <link
	linkend="enable-force-cgi-redirect">--enable-force-cgi-redirect</link>
	and runtime configuration directives <link
	linkend="ini.doc-root">doc_root</link> and <link
	linkend="ini.user-dir">user_dir</link> can be used to prevent
	this attack, if the server document tree has any directories
	with access restrictions.  See below for full explanation of
	different combinations.

    <sect2 id="security.cgi.default">
     <title>Case 1: only public files served</title>
     <simpara>
      If your server does not have any content that is not restricted
      by password or ip based access control, there is no need for
      these configuration options.  If your web server does not allow
      you to do redirects, or the server does not have a way to
      communicate with the PHP binary that the request is a safely
      redirected request, you can specify the option <link
      linkend="enable-force-cgi-redirect">--disable-force-cgi-redirect</link>
      to the configure script.  You still have to make sure your PHP
      scripts do not rely on one or another way of calling the script,
      neither by directly <filename
      role=php>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/dir/script.php3</filename>
      nor by redirection <filename
      role=php>http://my.host/dir/script.php3</filename>.

     <simpara>
      Redirection can be configured in Apache by
      using AddHandler and Action directives (see below).
      
    <sect2 id="security.cgi.force-redirect">
     <title>Case 2: using --enable-force-cgi-redirect</title>
     <simpara>
      This compile-time option prevents anyone from calling PHP
      directly with a url like <filename
      role=php>http://my.host/cgi-bin/php/secretdir/script.php3</filename>.
      Instead, PHP will only parse in this mode if it has gone through
      a web server redirect rule.
     <simpara>
      Usually the redirection in the Apache configuration is done with
      the following directives:
     <programlisting role="apache-conf">
Action php3-script /cgi-bin/php
AddHandler php3-script .php3
</programlisting>

     <simpara>
      This option has only been tested with the Apache web server, and
      relies on Apache to set the non-standard CGI environment
      variable <envar>REDIRECT_STATUS</envar> on redirected requests.
      If your web server does not support any way of telling if the
      request is direct or redirected, you cannot use this option and
      you must use one of the other ways of running the CGI version
      documented here.
      
    <sect2 id="security.cgi.doc-root">
     <title>Case 3: setting doc_root or user_dir</title>
     <simpara>
      To include active content, like scripts and executables, in the
      web server document directories is sometimes consider an
      insecure practice.  If for some configuration mistake the
      scripts are not executed but displayed as usual HTML documents,
      this may result in leakage of intellectual property or security
      information like passwords.  Therefore many sysadmins will
      prefer setting up another directory structure for scripts that
      is only accessible through the PHP CGI, and therefore always
      interpreted and not displayed as such.
      
     <simpara>
      Also if the method for making sure the requests are not
      redirected, as described in the previous section, is not
      available, it is necessary to set up a script doc_root that is
      different from web document root.
      
     <simpara>
      You can set the PHP script document root by the configuration
      directive <link linkend="ini.doc-root">doc_root</link> in the
      <link linkend="php3.ini">php3.ini</link> file, or you can set
      the environment variable <envar>PHP_DOCUMENT_ROOT</envar>.  If
      it is set, the CGI version of PHP will always construct the file
      name to open with this <parameter>doc_root</parameter> and the
      path information in the request, so you can be sure no script is
      executed outside this directory (except for
      <parameter>user_dir</parameter> below).
      
     <simpara>
      Another option usable here is <link
      linkend="ini.user-dir">user_dir</link>.  When user_dir is unset,
      only thing controlling the opened file name is
      <parameter>doc_root</parameter>.  Opening an url like <filename
      role=url>http://my.host/~user/doc.php3</filename> does not
      result in opening a file under users home directory, but a file
      called <filename role=uri>~user/doc.php3</filename> under
      doc_root (yes, a directory name starting with a tilde
      [<literal>~</literal>]).
      
     <simpara>
      If user_dir is set to for example <filename
      role=dir>public_php</filename>, a request like <filename
      role=url>http://my.host/~user/doc.php3</filename> will open a
      file called <filename>doc.php3</filename> under the directory
      named <filename role=dir>public_php</filename> under the home
      directory of the user.  If the home of the user is <filename
      role=dir>/home/user</filename>, the file executed is
      <filename>/home/user/public_php/doc.php3</filename>.
      
     <simpara>
      <parameter>user_dir</parameter> expansion happens regardless of
      the <parameter>doc_root</parameter> setting, so you can control
      the document root and user directory access separately.
      
    <sect2 id="security.cgi.shell">
     <title>Case 4: PHP parser outside of web tree</title>
     <para>
      A very secure option is to put the PHP parser binary somewhere
      outside of the web tree of files.  In <filename
      role=dir>/usr/local/bin</filename>, for example.  The only real
      downside to this option is that you will now have to put a line
      similar to:
      
      <informalexample>
       <programlisting>
#!/usr/local/bin/php
       </programlisting>
      </informalexample>
	
      as the first line of any file containing PHP tags.  You will
      also need to make the file executable.  That is, treat it
      exactly as you would treat any other CGI script written in Perl
      or sh or any other common scripting language which uses the
      <literal>#!</literal> shell-escape mechanism for launching
      itself.
     <para>
      To get PHP to handle <envar>PATH_INFO</envar> and
      <envar>PATH_TRANSLATED</envar> information correctly with this
      setup, the php parser should be compiled with the <link
      linkend="enable-discard-path">--enable-discard-path</link>
      configure option.

   <sect1 id="security.apache">
    <title>Apache module</title>
    <simpara>
     When PHP is used as an Apache module it inherits Apache's user
     permissions (typically those of the "nobody" user).
