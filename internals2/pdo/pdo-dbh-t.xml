    If this is set to 1, then any data that is referenced by the
    dbh, including whatever structure your driver allocates,
    <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> be allocated persistently.  This is easy to
    achieve; rather than using the usual <function>emalloc</function> simply
    use <function>pemalloc</function> and pass the value of this flag as the
    last parameter.  Failure to use the appropriate kind of memory can lead
    to serious memory faults, resulting (in the best case) a hard crash, and
    in the worst case, an exploitable memory problem.

    You should check this value in your <function>SKEL_handle_doer</function>
    and <function>SKEL_stmt_execute</function> functions; if it evaluates to
    true, you must attempt to commit the query now.  Most database
    implementations offer an auto-commit mode that handles this automatically.

    If your database client library API operates by fetching data into a
    caller-supplied buffer, you should set this flag to 1 during your
    <function>SKEL_handle_factory</function>.  When set, PDO will call your
    <function>SKEL_stmt_describer</function> earlier than it would
    otherwise.  This early call allows you to determine those buffer sizes
    and issue appropriate calls to the database client library.
   </para>
   <para>
    If your database client library API simply returns pointers to its own
    internal buffers for you to copy after each fetch call, you should leave
    this value set to 0.

    If your driver doesn't support native prepared statements
    (<parameter>supports_placeholders</parameter> is set to
    <constant>PDO_PLACEHOLDER_NONE</constant>), you must set
    this value to the maximum length that can be taken up by a single
    character when it is quoted by your
    <function>SKEL_handle_quoter</function> function.  This value is used to
    calculate the amount of buffer space required when PDO executes the
    statement.

    This holds the value of the DSN that was passed into the PDO
    constructor.  If your driver implementation needed to modify the DSN for
    whatever reason, it should update this member during
    <function>SKEL_handle_factory</function>.  Modifying this member should
    be avoided.  If you do change it, you must ensure that
    <parameter>data_source_len</parameter> is also correct.

   <para>
    Whenever an error occurs during a call to one of your driver methods,
    you should set this member to the SQLSTATE code that best describes the
    error and return an error.  In this HOW-TO, the suggested practice is to
    call <function>SKEL_handle_error</function> when an error is detected,
    and have it set the error code.

   <para>
    Your driver should set this during
    <function>SKEL_handle_factory</function>; the value should reflect how
    the database returns the names of the columns in result sets.  If the
    name matches the case that was used in the query, set it to
    <constant>PDO_CASE_NATURAL</constant> (this is actually the default).
    If the column names are always returned in upper case, set it to
    <constant>PDO_CASE_UPPER</constant>.  If the column names are always
    returned in lower case, set it to <constant>PDO_CASE_LOWER</constant>.
    The value you set is used to determine if PDO should perform case
    folding when the user sets the <constant>PDO_ATTR_CASE</constant>
    attribute.
