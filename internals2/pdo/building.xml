 <para>
  The build process is designed to work with PEAR (see <link
  xlink:href="&url.php.pear;"/> for more information about
  PEAR). There are two files that are used to assist in configuring your
  package for building. The first is config.m4 which is the
  <command>autoconf</command> configuration file for all platforms except
  Win32. The second is config.w32 which is a build configuration file for use
  on Win32. Skeleton files for these are built for you when you first set up
  your project. You then need to customize them to fit the needs of your
  project.  Once you've customized your config files, you can build your driver
  using the following sequence of commands:

 </para>

 <screen><![CDATA[
$ cd pdo_SKEL
$ phpize
$ ./configure

  The process can then be repeated as necessary during the development
  process.
