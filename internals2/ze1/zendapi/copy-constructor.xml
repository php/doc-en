  <title>Duplicating Variable Contents: The Copy Constructor</title>
  <para>
   Sooner or later, you may need to assign the contents of one
   <envar>zval</envar> container to another. This is easier said than
   done, since the <envar>zval</envar> container doesn't contain only
   type information, but also references to places in Zend's internal
   data. For example, depending on their size, arrays and objects may
   be nested with lots of hash table entries. By assigning one
   <envar>zval</envar> to another, you avoid duplicating the hash
   table entries, using only a reference to them (at most).
  </para>
  <para>
   To copy this complex kind of data, use the <emphasis>copy
    constructor</emphasis>. Copy constructors are typically defined in
   languages that support operator overloading, with the express
   purpose of copying complex types. If you define an object in such a
   language, you have the possibility of overloading the "=" operator,
   which is usually responsible for assigning the contents of the
   rvalue (result of the evaluation of the right side of the operator)
   to the lvalue (same for the left side).
  </para>
  <para>
   <emphasis>Overloading</emphasis> means assigning a different
   meaning to this operator, and is usually used to assign a function
   call to an operator. Whenever this operator would be used on such
   an object in a program, this function would be called with the
   lvalue and rvalue as parameters. Equipped with that information, it
   can perform the operation it intends the "=" operator to have
   (usually an extended form of copying).
  </para>
  <para>
   This same form of "extended copying" is also necessary for PHP's
   <envar>zval</envar> containers. Again, in the case of an array,
   this extended copying would imply re-creation of all hash table
   entries relating to this array. For strings, proper memory
   allocation would have to be assured, and so on.
  </para>
  <para>
   Zend ships with such a function,
   called <function>zend_copy_ctor</function> (the previous PHP equivalent
   was <function>pval_copy_constructor</function>).
  </para>
  <para>
   A most useful demonstration is a function that accepts a complex type as
   argument, modifies it, and then returns the argument:
  </para>
  <programlisting role="c">
<![CDATA[
zval *parameter;

if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "z", &parameter) == FAILURE)
   return;
}

// do modifications to the parameter here

// now we want to return the modified container:
*return_value = *parameter;
zval_copy_ctor(return_value);
]]>
  </programlisting>
  <para>
   The first part of the function is plain-vanilla argument retrieval.
   After the (left out) modifications, however, it gets interesting:
   The container of <envar>parameter</envar> is assigned to the
   (predefined) <envar>return_value</envar> container. Now, in order
   to effectively duplicate its contents, the copy constructor is
   called. The copy constructor works directly with the supplied
   argument, and the standard return values are
   <literal>FAILURE</literal> on failure and
   <literal>SUCCESS</literal> on success.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you omit the call to the copy constructor in this example, both
   <envar>parameter</envar> and <envar>return_value</envar> would
   point to the same internal data, meaning that
   <envar>return_value</envar> would be an illegal additional
   reference to the same data structures. Whenever changes occurred in
   the data that <envar>parameter</envar> points to,
   <envar>return_value</envar> might be affected. Thus, in order to
   create separate copies, the copy constructor must be used.
  </para>
  <para>
   The copy constructor's counterpart in the Zend API, the destructor
   <function>zval_dtor</function>, does the opposite of the
   constructor.
  </para>
