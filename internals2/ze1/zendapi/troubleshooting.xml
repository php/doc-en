   Actually, not much troubleshooting can be done when compiling
   static or dynamic modules. The only problem that could arise is
   that the compiler will complain about missing definitions or
   something similar. In this case, make sure that all header files
   are available and that you specified their path correctly in the
   compilation command. To be sure that everything is located
   correctly, extract a clean PHP source tree and use the automatic
   build in the <filename>ext</filename> directory with the fresh
   files; this will guarantee a safe compilation environment. If this
   fails, try manual compilation.  </para>

   PHP might also complain about missing functions in your module.
   (This shouldn't happen with the sample sources if you didn't modify
   them.) If the names of external functions you're trying to access
   from your module are misspelled, they'll remain as "unlinked
   symbols" in the symbol table. During dynamic loading and linkage by
   PHP, they won't resolve because of the typing errors - there are no
   corresponding symbols in the main binary. Look for incorrect
   declarations in your module file or incorrectly written external
   references. Note that this problem is specific to dynamic loadable
   modules; it doesn't occur with static modules. Errors in static
   modules show up at compile time.
