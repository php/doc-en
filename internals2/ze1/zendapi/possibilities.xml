  <title>Extension Possibilities</title> 
  <para>
   As shown <link linkend="internals2.ze1.zendapi.fig.internal-struct">above</link>, PHP can be extended primarily at
   three points: external modules, built-in modules, and the Zend
   engine. The following sections discuss these options.

  <sect3 xml:id="internals2.ze1.zendapi.possibilities.external"> 
   <title>External Modules</title> 
   <para>
    External modules can be loaded at script runtime using the
    function <function>dl</function>. This function loads a shared
    object from disk and makes its functionality available to the
    script to which it's being bound. After the script is terminated,
    the external module is discarded from memory. This method has both
    advantages and disadvantages, as described in the following table:
    
    <informaltable> 
     <tgroup cols="2">
      <colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="*"/>
      <colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="*"/> 
      <tbody> 
       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1">Advantages</entry>

         External modules don't require recompiling of PHP.
        </entry> 
        <entry colname="col2">
         The shared objects need to be loaded every time a script is
         being executed (every hit), which is very slow.
        </entry> 
       </row> 
       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1">
         The size of PHP remains small by "outsourcing" certain
         functionality.

         External additional files clutter up the disk.

       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1"></entry> 
        <entry colname="col2">
         Every script that wants to use an external module's
         functionality has to specifically include a call to
         <function>dl</function>, or the <literal>extension</literal>
         tag in <filename>php.ini</filename> needs to be modified
         (which is not always a suitable solution).
        </entry> 
       </row> 
      </tbody> 
     </tgroup> 
    </informaltable> To sum up, external modules are great for
    third-party products, small additions to PHP that are rarely used,
    or just for testing purposes. To develop additional functionality
    quickly, external modules provide the best results. For frequent
    usage, larger implementations, and complex code, the disadvantages
    outweigh the advantages.
   </para> 
   <para>
    Third parties might consider using the
    <literal>extension</literal> tag in <filename>php.ini</filename>
    to create additional external modules to PHP. These external
    modules are completely detached from the main package, which is a
    very handy feature in commercial environments. Commercial
    distributors can simply ship disks or archives containing only
    their additional modules, without the need to create fixed and
    solid PHP binaries that don't allow other modules to be bound to
    them.

  <sect3 xml:id="internals2.ze1.zendapi.possibilities.builtin"> 
   <title>Built-in Modules</title> 
   <para>
    Built-in modules are compiled directly into PHP and carried around
    with every PHP process; their functionality is instantly available
    to every script that's being run. Like external modules, built-in
    modules have advantages and disadvantages, as described in the
    following table:
    <informaltable> 
     <tgroup cols="2">
      <colspec colnum="1" colname="col1" colwidth="*"/>
      <colspec colnum="2" colname="col2" colwidth="*"/> 
      <tbody> 
       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1">Advantages</entry> 
        <entry colname="col2">Disadvantages</entry> 
       </row> 
       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1">
         No need to load the module specifically; the functionality is
         instantly available.
        </entry> 
        <entry colname="col2">
         Changes to built-in modules require recompiling of PHP.
        </entry> 
       </row> 
       <row> 
        <entry colname="col1">
         No external files clutter up the disk; everything resides in
         the PHP binary.
        </entry> 
        <entry colname="col2">
         The PHP binary grows and consumes more memory.
        </entry> 
       </row> 
      </tbody> 
     </tgroup> 
    </informaltable>
    Built-in modules are best when you have a solid
    library of functions that remains relatively unchanged, requires
    better than poor-to-average performance, or is used frequently by
    many scripts on your site. The need to recompile PHP is quickly
    compensated by the benefit in speed and ease of use. However,
    built-in modules are not ideal when rapid development of small
    additions is required.

  <sect3 xml:id="internals2.ze1.zendapi.possibilities.engine"> 
   <title>The Zend Engine</title> 
   <para>
    Of course, extensions can also be implemented directly in the Zend
    engine. This strategy is good if you need a change in the language
    behavior or require special functions to be built directly into
    the language core. In general, however, modifications to the Zend
    engine should be avoided. Changes here result in incompatibilities
    with the rest of the world, and hardly anyone will ever adapt to
    specially patched Zend engines. Modifications can't be detached
    from the main PHP sources and are overridden with the next update
    using the "official" source repositories. Therefore, this method
    is generally considered bad practice and, due to its rarity, is
    not covered in this book.
