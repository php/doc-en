  <title>Where to Go from Here</title> 
  <para>
   You've learned a lot about PHP. You now know how to create
   dynamic loadable modules and statically linked extensions. You've
   learned how PHP and Zend deal with internal storage of variables and how you
   can create and access these variables. You know quite a set of tool functions
   that do a lot of routine tasks such as printing informational texts,
   automatically introducing variables to the symbol table, and so on.

   Even though this chapter often had a mostly "referential" character, we
   hope that it gave you insight on how to start writing your own extensions.
   For the sake of space, we had to leave out a lot; we suggest that you take the time to
   study the header files and some modules (especially the ones in the
   <filename>ext/standard</filename> directory and the MySQL module, as these
   implement commonly known functionality). This will give you an idea of how
   other people have used the API functions - particularly those that didn't make it into
   this chapter.
