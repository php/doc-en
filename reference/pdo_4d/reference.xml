     PDO_4D is a driver that implements the
     <link linkend="intro.pdo">PHP Data Objects (PDO)</link>  interface
     to enable access from PHP to 4D databases.

     4D is an integrated platform that speeds and simplifies the development
     and deployment of business applications, used in over 70 countries, by
     a community of thousands of developers and vertical solution providers,
     with millions of end-users worldwide.
    </para>
    <para>
     By offering a suite of integrated tools such as an ANSI SQL relational
     and transactional database, a graphical development environment, a
     fourth-generation language with over 1000 high-level commands, a
     built-in HTTP server, application server, etc., 4D facilitates the
     creation and maintenance of applications from one to hundreds of
     simultaneous users, whether on Windows, Mac or from any Web client.
    </para>
    <para>
     4D is also an open platform, offering a complete API for plug-in
     creation, including various connectors that allow it to act as a
     back-end or front-end for many environments (Oracle via OCI, SOAP
     client or server, Flex data source, all ODBC databases, XML over
     HTTP, etc.)
    </para>
    <para>
     In addition to the ability to interact with 4D applications across
     Web Services, 4D databases can now be directly accessed using the
     PDO_4D driver.
