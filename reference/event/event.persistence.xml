 <title>About event persistence</title>
 <para>
  By default, whenever a pending event becomes active (because its file
  descriptor is ready to read or write, or because its timeout expires), it
  becomes non-pending right before its callback is executed. Thus, to make the
  event pending again one may call
  <methodname>Event::add</methodname>
  on it again from inside the callback function.
 </para>
 <para>
  If the
  <constant>Event::PERSIST</constant>
  flag is set on an event, however, the event is
  <emphasis>persistent</emphasis>
  . This means that event remains pending even when its callback is activated.
  <methodname>Event::del</methodname>
  method can be called to make it non-pending.
 </para>
 <para>
  The timeout on a persistent event resets whenever the event's callback runs.
  Thus, if one has an event with flags
  <constant>Event::READ</constant>
  <literal>|</literal>
  <constant>Event::PERSIST</constant>
  and a timeout of five seconds, the event will become active:
