 <title>Character type checking</title>

 <preface xml:id="intro.ctype">
  &reftitle.intro;
  <para>
   The functions provided by this extension check whether a character
   or string falls into a certain character class according to the
   current locale (see also <function>setlocale</function>). 
  </para>
  <para>
   When called with an integer argument these functions 
   behave exactly like their C counterparts from
   <filename>ctype.h</filename>.
   It means that if you pass an integer smaller than 256 it will use the
   ASCII value of it to see if it fits in the specified range (digits are in
   0x30-0x39). If the number is between -128 and -1 inclusive then 256 will
   be added and the check will be done on that.
  </para>
  <para>
   When called with a string argument they will check
   every character in the string and will only return
   &true; if every character in the string matches the
   requested criteria. When called with an empty string 
   the result will always be &true; in PHP &lt; 5.1 and &false; since 5.1.
  </para>
  <para>
   Passing anything else but a string or integer will
   return &false; immediately.
  </para>
  <para>
   It should be noted that ctype functions are always preferred over
   regular expressions, and even to some equivalent str_* and is_* functions.
   This is because of the fact that ctype uses a native C library and thus
   processes significantly faster.
