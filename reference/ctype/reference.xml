     The functions provided by this extension check whether a character
     or string falls into a certain character class according to the
     current locale (see also <function>setlocale</function>). 
    </para>
    <para>
     When called with an integer argument these functions 
     behave exactly like their C counterparts from
     <filename>ctype.h</filename>.
     It means that if you pass an integer smaller than 256 it will use the
     ASCII value of it to see if it fits in the specified range (digits are in
     0x30-0x39). If the number is between -128 (inclusive) and 0 then 256 will
     be added and the check will be done on that.
    </para>
    <para>
     When called with a string argument they will check
     every character in the string and will only return
     &true; if every character in the string matches the
     requested criteria. When called with an empty string 
     the result will always be &true;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Passing anything else but a string or integer will
     return &false; immediately.
    </para>
    <para>
     It should be noted that ctype functions are always preferred over
     regular expressions, and even to some equivalent str_* and is_* functions.
     This is because of the fact that ctype uses a native C library and thus
     processes significantly faster.

     None besides functions from the standard C library which are
