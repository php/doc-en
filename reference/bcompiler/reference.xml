     Bcompiler was written for two reasons:
     <simplelist>
      <member>To encode some classes in a proprietary PHP application</member>
      <member>
       To enable the production of php-gtk applications that could be used on
       client desktops, without the need for a php.exe.
      </member>
      <member>To do the feasibility study for a PHP to C converter</member>
     </simplelist>
     The first of these goals is achieved using the
     <function>bcompiler_write_header</function>,
     <function>bcompiler_write_class</function>,
     <function>bcompiler_write_footer</function>,
     <function>bcompiler_read</function>,
     and <function>bcompiler_load</function> functions. The bytecode files can
     be written as either uncompressed or plain. The
     <function>bcompiler_load</function> reads a bzip compressed bytecode file,
     which tends to be 1/3 of the size of the original file.
    </para>
    <para>
     To create EXE type files, bcompiler has to be used with a modified sapi
     file or a version of PHP which has been compiled as a shared library. In
     this scenario, bcompiler reads the compressed bytecode from the end of the
     exe file.
    </para>
    <para>
     bcompiler is unlikely to improve performance very much, as it only
     bypasses the compiler stage of the PHP running process and replaces it
     with the import process in bcompiler. It also does not do any bytecode
     optimization, this could be added in the future.
    </para>
    <para>
     In terms of code protection, it is safe to say that it would be impossible
     to recreate the exact source code that it was built from, and without the
     accompanying source code comments. It would effectively be useless to use
     the bcompiler bytecodes to recreate and modify a class. However it is
     possible to retrieve data from a bcompiled bytecode file - so don't put
     your private passwords or anything in it.
