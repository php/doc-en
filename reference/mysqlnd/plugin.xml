 <title>MySQL Native Driver Plugin API</title>
 <simpara>
  The MySQL Native Driver Plugin API is a feature of MySQL Native
  Driver, or <literal>mysqlnd</literal>. <literal>Mysqlnd</literal>
  plugins operate in the layer between PHP applications and the MySQL
  server. This is comparable to MySQL Proxy. MySQL Proxy operates on a
  layer between any MySQL client application, for example, a PHP
  application and, the MySQL server. <literal>Mysqlnd</literal> plugins
  can undertake typical MySQL Proxy tasks such as load balancing,
  monitoring and performance optimizations. Due to the different
  architecture and location, <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugins do not
  have some of MySQL Proxy's disadvantages. For example, with plugins,
  there is no single point of failure, no dedicated proxy server to
  deploy, and no new programming language to learn (Lua).
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  A <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin can be thought of as an extension
  to <literal>mysqlnd</literal>. Plugins can intercept the majority of
  <literal>mysqlnd</literal> functions. The <literal>mysqlnd</literal>
  functions are called by the PHP MySQL extensions such as
  <literal>ext/mysql</literal>, <literal>ext/mysqli</literal>, and
  <literal>PDO_MYSQL</literal>. As a result, it is possible for a
  <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin to intercept all calls made to these
  extensions from the client application.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  Internal <literal>mysqlnd</literal> function calls can also be
  intercepted, or replaced. There are no restrictions on manipulating
  <literal>mysqlnd</literal> internal function tables. It is possible to
  set things up so that when certain <literal>mysqlnd</literal>
  functions are called by the extensions that use
  <literal>mysqlnd</literal>, the call is directed to the appropriate
  function in the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin. The ability to
  manipulate <literal>mysqlnd</literal> internal function tables in this
  way allows maximum flexibility for plugins.
 </simpara>
 <simpara>
  <literal>Mysqlnd</literal> plugins are in fact PHP Extensions, written
  in C, that use the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin API (which is
  built into MySQL Native Driver, <literal>mysqlnd</literal>). Plugins
  can be made 100% transparent to PHP applications. No application
  changes are needed because plugins operate on a different layer. The
  <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin can be thought of as operating in a
  layer below <literal>mysqlnd</literal>.

  <title>A comparison of mysqlnd plugins with MySQL Proxy</title>
  <simpara>
   <literal>Mysqlnd</literal> plugins and MySQL Proxy are different
   technologies using different approaches. Both are valid tools for
   solving a variety of common tasks such as load balancing, monitoring,
   and performance enhancements. An important difference is that MySQL
   Proxy works with all MySQL clients, whereas
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugins are specific to PHP applications.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   As a PHP Extension, a <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin gets
   installed on the PHP application server, along with the rest of PHP.
   MySQL Proxy can either be run on the PHP application server or can be
   installed on a dedicated machine to handle multiple PHP application
   servers.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Deploying MySQL Proxy on the application server has two advantages:
  </simpara>
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     No single point of failure
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     Easy to scale out (horizontal scale out, scale by client)
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
  </orderedlist>
  <simpara>
   MySQL Proxy (and <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugins) can solve
   problems easily which otherwise would have required changes to
   existing applications.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   However, MySQL Proxy does have some disadvantages:
  </simpara>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     MySQL Proxy is a new component and technology to master and deploy.
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     MySQL Proxy requires knowledge of the Lua scripting language.
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <simpara>
   MySQL Proxy can be customized with C and Lua programming. Lua is the
   preferred scripting language of MySQL Proxy. For most PHP experts Lua
   is a new language to learn. A <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin can
   be written in C. It is also possible to write plugins in PHP using
   <link xlink:href="&url.pecl.package;mysqlnd_uh">PECL/mysqlnd_uh</link>.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   MySQL Proxy runs as a daemon - a background process. MySQL Proxy can
   recall earlier decisions, as all state can be retained. However, a
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin is bound to the request-based
   lifecycle of PHP. MySQL Proxy can also share one-time computed
   results among multiple application servers. A
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin would need to store data in a
   persistent medium to be able to do this. Another daemon would need to
   be used for this purpose, such as Memcache. This gives MySQL Proxy an
   advantage in this case.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   MySQL Proxy works on top of the wire protocol. With MySQL Proxy you
   have to parse and reverse engineer the MySQL Client Server Protocol.
   Actions are limited to those that can be achieved by manipulating the
   communication protocol. If the wire protocol changes (which happens
   very rarely) MySQL Proxy scripts would need to be changed as well.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   <literal>Mysqlnd</literal> plugins work on top of the C API, which
   mirrors the <literal>libmysqlclient</literal> client.
   This C API is basically a wrapper around the MySQL Client Server
   protocol, or wire protocol, as it is sometimes called. You can
   intercept all C API calls. PHP makes use of the C API, therefore you
   can hook all PHP calls, without the need to program at the level of
   the wire protocol.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   <literal>Mysqlnd</literal> implements the wire protocol. Plugins can
   therefore parse, reverse engineer, manipulate and even replace the
   communication protocol. However, this is usually not required.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   As plugins allow you to create implementations that use two levels (C
   API and wire protocol), they have greater flexibility than MySQL
   Proxy. If a <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin is implemented using
   the C API, any subsequent changes to the wire protocol do not require
   changes to the plugin itself.
  </simpara>

 <section xml:id="mysqlnd.plugin.obtaining">
  <title>Obtaining the mysqlnd plugin API</title>
  <simpara>
   The <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin API is simply part of the MySQL
   Native Driver PHP extension, <literal>ext/mysqlnd</literal>.
   Development started on the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin API in
   December 2009. It is developed as part of the PHP source repository,
   and as such is available to the public either via Git, or through
   source snapshot downloads.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Plugin developers can determine the <literal>mysqlnd</literal>
   version through accessing <literal>MYSQLND_VERSION</literal>, which
   is a string of the format <quote>mysqlnd 8.3.17</quote>, or through
   <literal>MYSQLND_VERSION_ID</literal>, which is an integer such as
   50007. Developers can calculate the version number as follows:
  </simpara>
  <table xml:id="mysqlnd.plugin.version-id">

  <simpara>
   During development, developers should refer to the
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> version number for compatibility and
   version tests, as several iterations of <literal>mysqlnd</literal>
   could occur during the lifetime of a PHP development branch with a
   single PHP version number.

   Before developing <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugins, it is useful to

  </table>
  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">C Object-Oriented Paradigm</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   At the code level, <literal>mysqlnd</literal> uses a C pattern for
   implementing object orientation.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   In C you use a <literal>struct</literal> to represent an object.
   Members of the struct represent object properties. Struct members
   pointing to functions represent methods.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Unlike with other languages such as C++ or Java, there are no fixed
   rules on inheritance in the C object-oriented paradigm. However,
   there are some conventions that need to be followed that will be
   discussed later.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">The PHP Life Cycle</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   When considering the PHP life cycle there are two basic cycles:
  </simpara>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     PHP engine startup and shutdown cycle
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <simpara>
     Request cycle
    </simpara>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <simpara>
   When the PHP engine starts up it will call the module initialization
   (MINIT) function of each registered extension. This allows each
   module to setup variables and allocate resources that will exist for
   the lifetime of the PHP engine process. When the PHP engine shuts
   down it will call the module shutdown (MSHUTDOWN) function of each
   extension.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   During the lifetime of the PHP engine it will receive a number of
   requests. Each request constitutes another life cycle. On each
   request the PHP engine will call the request initialization function
   of each extension. The extension can perform any variable setup and
   resource allocation required for request processing. As the request
   cycle ends the engine calls the request shutdown (RSHUTDOWN) function
   of each extension so the extension can perform any cleanup required.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">How a plugin works</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   A <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin works by intercepting calls made
   to <literal>mysqlnd</literal> by extensions that use
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal>. This is achieved by obtaining the
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> function table, backing it up, and
   replacing it by a custom function table, which calls the functions of
   the plugin as required.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The following code shows how the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> function
   table is replaced:
  </simpara>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
/* a place to store original function table */
struct st_mysqlnd_conn_methods org_methods;

void minit_register_hooks(TSRMLS_D) {
  /* active function table */
  struct st_mysqlnd_conn_methods * current_methods
    = mysqlnd_conn_get_methods();

  /* backup original function table */
  memcpy(&org_methods, current_methods,
    sizeof(struct st_mysqlnd_conn_methods);

  /* install new methods */
  current_methods->query = MYSQLND_METHOD(my_conn_class, query);
}
]]>
</programlisting>
  <simpara>
   Connection function table manipulations must be done during Module
   Initialization (MINIT). The function table is a global shared
   resource. In an multi-threaded environment, with a TSRM build, the
   manipulation of a global shared resource during the request
   processing will almost certainly result in conflicts.
  </simpara>
  <note>
   <simpara>
    Do not use any fixed-size logic when manipulating the
    <literal>mysqlnd</literal> function table: new methods may be added
    at the end of the function table. The function table may change at
    any time in the future.
   </simpara>
  </note>
  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">Calling parent methods</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   If the original function table entries are backed up, it is still
   possible to call the original function table entries - the parent
   methods.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   In some cases, such as for
   <literal>Connection::stmt_init()</literal>, it is vital to call the
   parent method prior to any other activity in the derived method.
  </simpara>
<programlisting>
<![CDATA[
MYSQLND_METHOD(my_conn_class, query)(MYSQLND *conn,
  const char *query, unsigned int query_len TSRMLS_DC) {

  php_printf("my_conn_class::query(query = %s)\n", query);

  query = "SELECT 'query rewritten' FROM DUAL";
  query_len = strlen(query);

  return org_methods.query(conn, query, query_len); /* return with call to parent */
}
]]>
</programlisting>
  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">Extending properties</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   A <literal>mysqlnd</literal> object is represented by a C struct. It
   is not possible to add a member to a C struct at run time. Users of
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> objects cannot simply add properties to
   the objects.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Arbitrary data (properties) can be added to a
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> objects using an appropriate function of
   the
   <literal>mysqlnd_plugin_get_plugin_&lt;object&gt;_data()</literal>
   family. When allocating an object <literal>mysqlnd</literal> reserves
   space at the end of the object to hold a <literal>void *</literal>
   pointer to arbitrary data. <literal>mysqlnd</literal> reserves space
   for one <literal>void *</literal> pointer per plugin.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The following table shows how to calculate the position of the
   pointer for a specific plugin:

  <simpara>
   You must not manipulate function tables at any time later than MINIT
   if it is not allowed according to the above table.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Some classes contain a pointer to the method function table. All
   instances of such a class will share the same function table. To
   avoid chaos, in particular in threaded environments, such function
   tables must only be manipulated during MINIT.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Other classes use copies of a globally shared function table. The
   class function table copy is created together with the object. Each
   object uses its own function table. This gives you two options: you
   can manipulate the default function table of an object at MINIT, and
   you can additionally refine methods of an object without impacting
   other instances of the same class.
  </simpara>

   The advantage of the shared function table approach is performance.
   There is no need to copy a function table for each and every object.

   It is strongly recommended that you do not entirely replace a
   constructor. The constructors perform memory allocations. The memory
   allocations are vital for the <literal>mysqlnd</literal> plugin API
   and the object logic of <literal>mysqlnd</literal>. If you do not
   care about warnings and insist on hooking the constructors, you
   should at least call the parent constructor before doing anything in
   your constructor.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Regardless of all warnings, it can be useful to subclass
   constructors. Constructors are the perfect place for modifying the
   function tables of objects with non-shared object tables, such as
   Resultset, Network, Wire Protocol.

  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The listed destructors may not be equivalent to the actual
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal> method freeing the object itself. However,
   they are the best possible place for you to hook in and free your
   plugin data. As with constructors you may replace the methods
   entirely but this is not recommended. If multiple methods are listed
   in the above table you will need to hook all of the listed methods
   and free your plugin data in whichever method is called first by
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal>.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The recommended method for plugins is to simply hook the methods,
   free your memory and call the parent implementation immediately
   following this.

  <simpara>
   <emphasis role="bold">No Restrictions</emphasis>
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   A plugin has full access to the inner workings of
   <literal>mysqlnd</literal>. There are no security limits or
   restrictions. Everything can be overwritten to implement friendly or
   hostile algorithms. It is recommended you only deploy plugins from a
   trusted source.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   As discussed previously, plugins can use pointers freely. These
   pointers are not restricted in any way, and can point into another
   plugin's data. Simple offset arithmetic can be used to read another
   plugin's data.
  </simpara>

   It is recommended that you write cooperative plugins, and that you
   always call the parent method. The plugins should always cooperate

   Both subclass <literal>Connection::query()</literal>. Plugin
