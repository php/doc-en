   <para>
    The phar extension
    provides the <literal>phar</literal> stream wrapper and the <classname>Phar</classname>
    class for manipulating self-contained PHP Archive (phar) files.  The
    Phar class can be used to create and to extract contents of phar files as
    well as iterating over their contents.
   </para>
   <para>
    PHP Archive files (Phars) are special collections of files that can be transparently
    run right out of the file, similar to Java's jar archive files.  Using a phar archive,
    it is possible to distribute a complete PHP application in a single file that will
    run out of the file without modification or extraction.  Phar
    archives can also be used to store files for extraction similar to tar or zip
    archive files.  Phars support compression using gzip if the
    <link linkend="ref.zlib">zlib</link> extension is present, and using bzip2 if
    the <link linkend="ref.bzip2">bz2</link> extension is present.  In addition,
    iteration and other features are available if the <link linkend="ref.spl">SPL</link>
    extension is available.  Phar signature verification using md5 or sha1 is natively
    supported to ensure archive integrity.
   </para>
   <para>
    The original implementation for Phar archives was in the PEAR package
    <ulink url="http://pear.php.net/PHP_Archive">PHP_Archive</ulink>, and
    the implementation details are very similar, although the Phar extension
    is more full-featured.  PHP_Archive has more flexibility in Phar creation,
    and helpful debugging tools like the <classname>PHP_Archive_Manager</classname>
    class, and the Phar extension supports iteration, array access, and
    directly manipulating Phar contents through a simple interface.  PHP_Archive
    supports creation of Phar archives that can be processed using the Phar
    extension or PHP_Archive seamlessly, whereas the Phar extension is designed
    to create extensions that function with the Phar extension.  In addition,
    the Phar extension will continue to work even if the
    <link linkend="ini.allow-url-include">allow_url_include</link> or
    <link linkend="ini.allow-url-fopen">allow_url_fopen</link> INI variables
    are disabled, while PHP_Archive-based Phar archives (without the Phar extension)
    will not function.
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="phar.requirements" >
   &reftitle.required;
   <para>
    Phar requires PHP 5.2.0 or newer.  Additional features require the
    <link linkend="ref.spl">SPL</link> extension in order to take advantage
    of iteration and array access to a Phar's file contents.  The <literal>phar</literal>
    stream does not require any additional extensions to function.
   </para>
   <para>
    You may optionally wish to enable the <link linkend="ref.zlib" >zlib</link>
    and <link linkend="ref.bzip2" >bzip2</link> extensions to take
    advantage of compressed phar support.

    The Phar extension provides the <literal>phar</literal> stream, which
    allows accessing files contained within a phar transparently.  The
    file format of a Phar is described <link linkend="phar.fileformat">here</link>
