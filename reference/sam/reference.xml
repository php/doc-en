     This extension provides access to the functionality of messaging and
     queueing systems, such as the IBM WebSphere MQSeries family of products,
     from PHP scripts. The interface is designed to make it extremely simple
     to do the more commonly required tasks such as deliver simple text
     messages to queues while still allowing skilled users to do more complex
     messaging operations. For many users the complexities of setting up
     numerous options can be simply ignored.

       The SAM extension interfaces to the IBM Messaging and Queuing
       middleware products using a set of libraries and some client side code
       referred to as XMS. This package is available as a free download in
       the guise of IBM support pack IA94. There is a description of this
       package and download links in the article <ulink url="&url.ibm.ia94;">
       Introducing XMS - The IBM Message Service API</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you intend to use SAM to access the Messaging and Queuing
       infrastructure within WebSphere MQ then you will also need to have
       installed a local MQ queue manager or installed the WebSphere MQ
       clients package. The clients package is freely available as a support
       pack (<ulink url="&url.ibm.mqc6;">MQC6</ulink>).
      </para>
      <para>
       If you are only aiming to experiment with sending messages to and from
       WebSphere Application Server queues using the WebSphere Platform
       Messaging protocol (WPM) then you do not need to install the MQC6
       package.
      </para>
      <para>
       After installing these packages you will need to ensure the XMS binary
       and, if you are using it, the MQ client bin directory are included in
       the PATH environment variable so that Apache and PHP can find the
       dependent .DLLs/libraries.

       The sam extension is supplied as a PECL module, which
       you should be able to download and install in one step as follows:
       <screen>
<![CDATA[
pear install sam

       </screen>
       (Depending on your php environment, you will probably need to be root
       to do this.)
      </para>
      <para>
       Make sure that the module is loaded by PHP, by adding following line
       to &php.ini;:

       If you cannot use the PEAR installer, you can download the extension

       To work with the very latest source, you'll need to extract it from

       Currently you will need to build the sam extension for Windows as
       there are no pre-built binaries. The extension can be built using the
       standard Windows extension build procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       You will need the PHP source tree for the version of PHP you wish to
       build the SAM extension against which you can obtain from php.net. 
       This should be unpacked into a working directory of your choice.
      </para>
      <para>
       You will also need the libraries and headers used by PHP extensions
       available from http://www.php.net/extra/win32build.zip and this
       should be unzipped so that is in your working directory.
      </para>
      <para>
       You should have something like:

      <para>
       You will need a compiler such as the free version of Visual Studio C++
       Express from the Microsoft web site. Also you need the Microsoft
       Windows Platform SDK which again can be downloaded from the Microsoft web site.
      </para>
      <para>
       Obtain the SAM extension source using pear (pear download sam) or by
       using CVS and copy the files to a new "sam" directory under the "ext"
       directory in your PHP source tree.
      </para>
      <para>
       To build the extension open a build environment window by going to the
       start menu->all programs->microsoft platform SDK for windows->
       open build environment window->windows 200 build environment->
       set windows 2000 build environment (retail)
      </para>
      <para>
       This should open a command prompt with all the environment variables
       set up to access the platform SDK etc. You then need to set the
       environment variables for Visual Studio by issuing the command
       "vcvars32.bat" in the window.
      </para>
      <para>
       Change directory to your working directory e.g. cd c:\php-build. Then

       Run the cscript command:

       the XMS libraries and runtime that were installed as described under
       prerequisites at the top of this file.

      <para>
       You can specify whatever other cscript parameters you require to
       include or exclude items from the php build or select options.

      <para>
       If you build the SAM extension with the Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
       compiler and tools you need to perform an additional step in the build
       process to ensure the <filename>php_sam.dll</filename> is able to link
       with the C runtime libraries at runtime. This step includes the
       dependancy manifest into the DLL. Switch to the directory where the
       <filename>php_sam.dll</filename> has been generated (usually 
       Release_TS or Debug_TS below the php source directory) and issue the
       following magic incantation:

      </para>
      <para>
       If you build the SAM extension using the compiler and libaries from
       Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 you will also need to ensure that the
       runtime components are installed on the system on which you intend to
       use SAM. This can be accomplished by installing Visual Studio 2005 or
       by using the freely distributable 
       <ulink url="&url.ms.crt;">runtime package</ulink>.

      <para>
       In order to perform any messaging and queueing functions a connection
       must be established with a messaging server by creating a SAMConnection
       object and calling its "connect" method, with a set of connection
       properties, to connect the PHP script to the messaging server.  Until
       such time as the SAMConnection object is destroyed the connection
       will be maintained and available for use. All SAMConnection objects
       are destroyed when the PHP script exits.
     </para>
     <para>
       A set of default properties may be used in connecting to a messaging
       server but as a minimum the PHP script must specify a protocol to be
       used.

      Messages sent to and received from queues are represented by the
      SAMMessage object. The SAMMessage object encapsulates the body of
      the message (if one exists) and the header properties associated with
      the message. A SAMMessage object is either supplied as a parameter to
      a messaging operation or returned as a result.

     <para>
      Messages may have header properties associated with them that provide
      control over the transport of the message or further information to the
      receiving application. By default message properties are delivered to
      the underlying messaging system as strings and in this case they may be

      All messaging operations are performed through calls to methods on the

      To add a message to a queue the "send" method is used, to obtain a

     <title>Publish/Subscribe and suscriptions to topics</title>
     <para>
      SAM allows messages to be sent either to queues or, for WebSphere MQ
      and WPM, to publish/subscribe topics.
      A topic desintation is specified to SAM in the usual way, i.e. in the
      form 'topic://fred', rather than the form 'queue://AQUEUE' used for
      point to point operation. To use publish/subscribe it is simply
      necessary to specify the correct broker name on the SAMConnect
      "connect" call and the desired topic in the destination argument to
      the SAMConnect "send" and "receive" calls. The PHP interface is
      otherwise identical to the point to point model.
     </para>
     <para>
      By default, SAM creates non-durable subscriptions when using 
      publish/subscribe. This means that if a client application is 
      inactive when messages are published to a topic, then it will not
      receive them when it subsequently restarted. SAM does also allow
      durable subscriptions to be made to topics when using WPM or WebSphere
      MQ publish/subscribe. The purpose of these subscriptions is to allow
      data to be received by a client application even if that client was not
      active at the time the data was published.
     </para>
     <para>
      Durable subscriptions are specified by using the SAMConnect "subscribe"
      call. This method takes the destination topic as an input parameter and
      returns a subscription identifier that may be used on subsequent 
      "receive" calls. When the subscription is no longer required the
      SAMConnection "unsubscribe" method should be used to delete the 
      subscription.
