 <title>Write Concerns</title>

 <para>
  MongoDB provides several different ways of selecting how durable a write to
  the database should be. These ways are called <literal>Write
  Concerns</literal> and span everything from completely ignoring all errors,
  to specifically targetting which servers are required to confirm the write
  before returning the operation.
 </para>
 <para>
  When a write (such as with <methodname>MongoCollection::insert</methodname>,
  <methodname>MongoCollection::update</methodname>, and
  <methodname>MongoCollection::remove</methodname>) is given a Write Concern
  option (<literal>"w"</literal>) the driver will send the query to MongoDB
  and piggy back a <literal>getLastError</literal> command
  (<acronym>GLE</acronym>) with the Write Concern option at the same time.
  The server only returns when the Write Concern condition is verified to be
  fulfilled, or the query times out (controlled with the
  <literal>"wtimeout"</literal> option, <literal>10000</literal> milliseconds
  is the default).
 </para>

 <warning>
  <para>
   Even though a <literal>getLastError</literal> command times out the data
   will most likely have been written to the primary server and will be
   replicated to all the secondaries once they have caught up.
  </para>
  <para>
   The typical reasons for a timeout to happen is if you specify a Write
   Concern which requires confirmation from more servers then you currently
   have available.
  </para>
 </warning>

 <para>
  When using acknowledged writes and the replica set has failed over, the driver
  will automatically disconnect from the primary, throw an exception, and
  attempt to find a new primary on the next operation (your application must
  decide whether or not to retry the operation on the new primary).
 </para>
 <para>
  When using unacknowledged writes (w=0) and the replica set has failed over,
  there will be no way for the driver to know about the change so it will
  continue and silently fail to write.
 </para>
 <para>
  The default Write Concern for the <classname>MongoClient</classname> is
  <literal>1</literal>: acknowledge write operations.
 </para>

  <title>Using WriteConcerns</title>
  <para>
   Each of the methods that causes writes
   (<methodname>MongoCollection::insert</methodname>,
   <methodname>MongoCollection::update</methodname>, 
   <methodname>MongoCollection::remove</methodname>, and
   <methodname>MongoCollection::batchInsert</methodname>) allow an optional
   argument to send a set of options to the MongoDB server. With this option
   array you can set the WriteConcern as the following example illustrates:
  </para>
  <example>
   <title>Passing a WriteConcern to a write operation</title>
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// Setting w=0 for insert:
$collection->insert($someDoc, array("w" => 0));

// Setting w=majority for update:
$collection->update($someDoc, $someUpdates, array("w" => "majority"));

// Setting w=5 and j=true for remove:
$collection->update($someDoc, array("w" => 5, "j" => true));

// Setting w="AllDCs" for batchInsert:
$collection->update(array($someDoc1, $someDoc2), array("w" => "AllDCs"));
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>
  <para>
   Besides setting WriteConcerns per operation as an option argument, it is
   also possible to set a default WriteConcern in different ways.
  </para>
  <para>
   The first way is through the <link
   linkend="mongo.mongoclient.construct.parameters">connection
   string</link>. The connection string accepts the
   <literal>journal</literal>, <literal>w</literal>, and
   <literal>wTimeoutMS</literal> options:
  </para>
  <example>
   <title>Connection string WriteConcerns</title>
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$m = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost/?journal=true&w=majority&wTimeoutMS=20000");
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>
   Since driver version 1.5 it is also possible to call
   <methodname>MongoDB::setWriteConcern</methodname> and
   <methodname>MongoCollection::setWriteConcern</methodname> to set a default
   WriteConcern for all operations created from that specific
   <classname>MongoDB</classname> or <classname>MongoCollection</classname>
   object:
  </para>
  <example>
   <title>MongoDB::setWriteConcern and MongoCollection::setWriteConcern</title>
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$m = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost/");
$d = $m->demoDb;
$c = $d->demoCollection;

// Set w=3 on the database object with a timeout of 25000ms
$d->setWriteConcern(3, 25000);

// Set w=majority on the collection object without changing the timeout
$c->setWriteConcern("majority");
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>

 <simplesect xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.unacknowledged">
  <title>Unacknowledged Writes</title>
  <para>
   By not requiring the server to acknowledge writes the writes can be performed
   extremely quickly, but you don't know whether or not they actually succeeded.
   Writes can fail for a number of reasons: if there are network problems, if a 
   database server goes down, or if the write was simply invalid (e.g., writing 
   to a system collection; or duplicate key errors).
  </para>
  <para>
   While developing, you should always use acknowledged writes (to protect against 
   inadvertent mistakes, such as syntax errors, invalid operators, duplicate key errors and so on).  In 
   production, unacknowledged writes can be used for "unimportant" data.  Unimportant
   data varies on application, but it's generally automatically (instead of user
   generated) data, such as click tracking or GPS locations, where you can get
   thousands of records per second.
  </para>
  <para>
   It is strongly recommended that you do an acknowledged write at the end of
   series of unacknowledged writes. Doing so will not incur in a too large
   performance penalty, but still allow you to catch any errors that may have
   occurred.
  </para>
  <example xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.unacknowledged-example">
   <title>Unacknowledged WriteConcern, followed with Acknowledged Write</title>
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$collection->insert($someDoc, array("w" => 0));
$collection->update($criteria, $newObj, array("w" => 0));
$collection->insert($somethingElse, array("w" => 0));
try {
    $collection->remove($something, array("w" => 1));
} catch(MongoCursorException $e) {
    /* Handle the exception.. */
    /* Here we should issue find() queries on the IDs generated for
    $somethingElse and $someDoc to verify they got written to the database and
    attempt to figureout where in the chain something happened. */
}
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
   <para>
    If the last write throws an exception, you know that there's a problem
    with your database.
   </para>
  </example>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.acknowledged">
  <title>Acknowledged Writes</title>
  <para>
   These type of write operations will make sure that the database has
   accepted the write operation before returning success. If the write failed,
   it will throw a <classname>MongoCursorException</classname> with an
   explanation of the failure. The <classname>MongoClient</classname> default
   behaviour is to acknowledge the write (w=1).
  </para>
  <para>
   It is possible to specify how many members of an replica set have to
   acknowledge the write (i.e. have it replicated) before the write is deemed
   acknowledged and the operation returns.
   <example xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.acknowledged-example">
    <title>Acknowledged Writes</title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// Force acknowledgement from the primary only
$collection->insert($doc, array("w" => 1));

// Force acknowledgement from the primary, and one other member of the
// replica set
$collection->insert($doc, array("w" => 2));

// Force acknowledgement from the primary, and six other members of the
// replica set (you probably never should do this):
$collection->insert($doc, array("w" => 7));
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
    <para>
     Keep in mind to select your Write Concern carefully. If you have a
     replica set with 5 members, and you select Write Concern of
     <literal>4</literal> you will risk the write blocking forever when one
     member of the replica set goes down for maintenance or a temporary network
     outage happens.
    </para>
   </example>
  </para>
  <warning>
   <para>
    Passing in a string value for Write Concern has a specific meaning
    (Replica Set Tag Set Acknowledged). Please be careful of
    <emphasis>NOT</emphasis> using string values for numbers (i.e.
    <literal>array("w" => "1")</literal>) as it will be treated as a tag set
    name.
   </para>
  </warning>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.majority.acknowledged">
  <title>Majority Acknowledged Writes</title>
  <para>
   Using the special <literal>majority</literal> Write Concern option is the
   recommended way for writes that are required to survive the apocalypse, as
   it will ensure the majority of your replica set will have the write and will
   therefore be guaranteed to survive all usual suspect outage scenarios.
  </para>
  <example xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.majority.acknowledged-example">

 <simplesect xml:id="mongo.writeconcerns.journal">
  <title>Journaled Writes</title>
  <para>
   When connecting to a replica set the default Write Concern is only to have
   the primary server acknowledge the write. There is however a 100ms window
   until the write gets journaled and flushed to disk. It is possible to force
   the write to be journaled before acknowledging the write by setting the
   <literal>j</literal> option:
