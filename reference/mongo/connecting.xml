 <para>
  Connecting to MongoDB can be as easy as <literal>new MongoClient</literal>,
  but there are many additional options and configurations. The documentation
  for <function>MongoClient::__construct</function> covers all of the API
  options, but this page gives some more details and advice for practical use
  cases.

   The driver supports connecting to <link xlink:href="&url.mongodb.docs.configure-ssl;">MongoDB over SSL</link>
   and can optionally use <link linkend="context.ssl">SSL Stream Context</link> options to provide more details,
   such as verifying certificates against specific certificate chain, or authenticate to

  <para>
   The PHP driver will query the database server(s) listed to determine the

   primary, the connection will succeed. If it cannot make a connection to any
   servers listed or cannot find a primary, a
   <classname>MongoConnectionException</classname> will be thrown.
  </para>
  <tip>
   <para>
    You should always provide a seed list with more than one member of the
    ReplicaSet. For highest availability you should seed with at least one
    server from each of your datacenters.
   </para>
  </tip>
  <warning>
   <para>
    The host names that you specify in the seed list <emphasis>must</emphasis>
    match the host names in the replica set configuration. This is because the
    driver only uses the host names in the replica set configuration to create
    the hash for its persistent connections.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, if an IP address is used in the seed list and the replica set
    is configured with host names, the driver will discard any seed list
    connection(s) that differ from the canonical host names reported by the
    replica set. Effectively, these non-canonical seed list connections will be
    recreated on each request, greatly reducing the benefit of using persistent
    connections.

    The driver does <emphasis>not</emphasis> support connecting to different

   If the primary becomes unavailable, an election will take place and a
   secondary will be promoted to the role of primary (unless a majority vote
   cannot be established). During this time
   (<link xlink:href="&url.mongodb.replica.failover;">20-60 seconds</link>), the
   connection will not be able to perform any write operations and attempts to
   do so will result in an exception. Connections to secondaries will still be
   able to perform reads.
  </para>
  <note>
   <para>
    The default <link linkend="mongo.readpreferences">Read Preference</link>
    is to only read from the primary. During the election process there is no
    primary, and all read will therefore fail.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is recommended to use
    <constant>MongoClient::RP_PRIMARY_PREFERRED</constant> Read Preference for
    applications that require high availability for reads, as reads will only
    be executed on the secondaries when there simply isn't a primary
    available.
   </para>
  </note>
  <para>
   Once a primary is elected, attempting to perform a read or write will allow
   the driver to detect the new primary. The driver will make this its primary
   database connection and continue operating normally.
  </para>
  <para>
   The health and state of a secondary is checked every 5 seconds
   (configurable with
   <link linkend="ini.mongo.ping-interval">mongo.ping_interval</link>)
   or when the next operation occurs after 5 seconds.  It will also recheck
   the configuration when the driver has a problem reaching a server.

  <para>
   Replica set failovers are checked every 60 seconds (configurable with
   <link linkend="ini.mongo.is-master-interval">mongo.is_master_interval</link>),
   and whenever a write operation fails when using acknowledged writes.
  </para>

  <caution>
   <para>
    Secondaries may be behind the primary in operations, so

  <title>Persistent Connections (version 1.3.0+)</title>

  <para>
   All versions of the driver since 1.3.0 utilize persistent connections to
   minimize the number of connections made to each database server. These
   connections are saved by the PHP worker process and may be reused between
   multiple requests.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before connecting to a database server, the driver will create a hash for the
   connection based on its host, port, replica set name (if any), any
   authentication credentials (e.g. username, password, database), and the
   process ID. If a connection already exists for that hash, it will be used in
   lieu of creating a new connection associated with that hash.
   <function>MongoClient::getConnections</function> may be used to retrieve info

  <note>
   <para>
    This section is no longer relevant as of the 1.3.0 release of the driver
    and only serves as a historical information on how the pooling used to
    work.
   </para>
   <para>
    The latest versions of the driver have no concept of pooling anymore and

    (ReplicaSet/standalone/mongos), for each credentials combination.
    </para>
   </note>
  <para>
   Creating connections is one of the most heavyweight things that the driver
   does. It can take hundreds of milliseconds to set up a connection correctly,
   even on a fast network. Thus, the driver tries to minimize the number of new
   connections created by reusing connections from a pool.
  </para>
  <para>
   When a user creates a new instance of <classname>MongoClient</classname>, all
   necessary connections will be taken from their pools (replica sets may
   require multiple connections, one for each member of the set). When the
   <classname>MongoClient</classname> instance goes out of scope, the
   connections will be returned to the pool. When the PHP process exits, all
   connections in the pools will be closed.
  </para>
  <section>
   <title>"Why do I have so many open connections?"</title>
   <para>
    Connection pools can generate a large number of connections. This is
    expected and, using a little arithmetic, you can figure out how many
    connections will be created. There are three factors in determining the
    total number of connections:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>
       connections_per_pool
      </literal>
     </para>
     <para>
      Each connection pool will create, by default, an unlimited number of
      connections. One might assume that this is a problem: if it can create an
      unlimited number of connections, couldn't it create thousands and the
      server would run out of file descriptors? In practice, this is unlikely,
      as unused connections are returned to the pool to be used later, so future
      connections will use the same connection instead of creating a new one.
      Unless you create thousands of connections at once without letting any go
      out of scope, the number of connections open should stay at a reasonable
      number.
     </para>
     <para>
      You can see how many connections you have in a pool using the
      <function>MongoPool::info</function> function. Add up the "in use" and
      "in pool" fields for a given server. That is the total number of
      connections for that pool.
     </para>

       pools_per_process
      </literal>
     </para>
     <para>
      Each MongoDB server address you're connecting to gets its own connection
      pool. For example, if your local hostname is "example.net", connecting
      to "example.net:27017", "localhost:27017", and "/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock"
      will create three connection pools. You can see how many connection pools
      you have open using <function>MongoPool::info</function>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      <literal>
       processes
      </literal>
     </para>
     <para>
      Each PHP process has a separate set of pools. PHP-FPM and Apache
      generally create between 6 and a couple of dozen PHP worker children.
      Check your settings to see what the max number of PHP processes is that
      can be spawned.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you are using PHP-FPM, estimating the number of connections can be
      tricky because it will spawn more PHP-FPM workers under heavy load. To be
      on the safe side, look at the <literal>max_children</literal> parameter or
      add up <literal>spare_servers</literal> + <literal>start_servers</literal>
      (choose whichever number is higher). That will indicate how many PHP
      processes (i.e. sets of pools) you should plan for.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    The three variables above can be multiplied together to give the max
    number of connections expected:
    <literal>connections_per_pool</literal> *
    <literal>pools_per_process</literal> *
    <literal>processes</literal>. Note that
    <literal>connections_per_pool</literal> can be different for different
    pools, so <literal>connections_per_pool</literal> should be the max.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, suppose we're getting 30 connections per pool, 10 pools per PHP
    process, and 128 PHP processes. Then we can expect 38400 connections from
    this machine. Thus, we should set this machine's file descriptor limit to
    be high enough to handle all of these connections or it may run out of file
    descriptors.
   </para>

    See <classname>MongoPool</classname> for more information on connection

  <title>Manually Persistent Connections (version up to 1.1.4 *only*)</title>
  <note>
   <para>
    This section is not relevant for 1.2.0+. In 1.2.0+, connections are always
    persistent and managed automatically by the driver. If you are using a
    1.2.x release (but not 1.3.x or later), see
    <classname>MongoPool</classname> for more information on pooling.

  <para>
   Creating new connection to the database is very slow. To minimize the number
   of connections that you need to make, you can use persistent connections. A
   persistent connection is saved by PHP, so you can use the same connection for
   multiple requests.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, this simple program connects to the database 1000 times:
  </para>

  <example xml:id="mongo.connecting.no-manual-persist-example">
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

for ($i=0; $i<1000; $i++) {
  $m = new MongoClient();
}

?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>
   It takes approximately 18 seconds to execute. If we change it to use a
   persistent connection:
  </para>

  <example xml:id="mongo.connecting.manual-persist-example">
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

for ($i=0; $i<1000; $i++) {
  $m = new MongoClient("localhost:27017", array("persist" => "x"));
}

?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </example>

  <para>
   ...it takes less than .02 seconds to execute, as it only makes one database
   connection.
  </para>

  <para>
   Persistent connections need an identifier string (which is "x" in the above
   example) to uniquely identify them. For a persistent connection to be used,
   the hostname, port, persist string, and authentication credentials (username,
   password and database, if given) must match an existing persistent
   connection. Otherwise, a new connection will be created with this identifying
   information.
  </para>
  <para>
   Persistent connections are <emphasis>highly recommended</emphasis> and should
   always be used in production unless there is a compelling reason not to.
   Most of the reasons that they are not recommended for relational databases
   are irrelevant to MongoDB.
