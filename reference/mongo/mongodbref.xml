    This class can be used to create lightweight links between objects in 
    different collections.
   </para>
   <para>
    <emphasis>Motivation</emphasis>: Suppose we need to refer to a document in 
    another collection. The easiest way is to create a field in the current 
    document.  For example, if we had a "people" collection and an "addresses"
    collection, we might want to create a link between each person document and
    an address document:
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$people = $db->people;
$addresses = $db->addresses;

$myAddress = array("line 1" => "123 Main Street", 
    "line 2" => null,
    "city" => "Springfield",
    "state" => "Vermont",
    "country" => "USA");

// save the address
$addresses->insert($myAddress);

// save a person with a reference to the address
$me = array("name" => "Fred", "address" => $myAddress['_id']);
$people->insert($me);

?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Then, later on, we can find the person's address by querying the "addresses"
    collection with the <classname>MongoId</classname> we saved in the "people"
    collection.
   </para>
   <para>
    Suppose now that we have a more general case, where we don't know which
    collection (or even which database) contains the referenced document.  
    <classname>MongoDBRef</classname> is a good choice for this case, as it is a
    common format that all of the drivers and the database understand.
   </para>
   <para>
    If each person had a list of things they liked which could come from
    multiple collections, such as "hobbies", "sports", "books", etc., we could
    use <classname>MongoDBRef</classname>s to keep track of what "like" went
    with what collection:
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$people = $db->selectCollection("people");

// model trains are in the "hobbies" collection
$trainRef = MongoDBRef::create("hobbies", $modelTrains['_id']);
// soccer is in the "sports" collection
$soccerRef = MongoDBRef::create("sports", $soccer['_id']);

// now we'll know what collections the items in the "likes" array came from when
// we retrieve this document
$people->insert(array("name" => "Fred", "likes" => array($trainRef, $soccerRef)));

?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   <para>
    Database references can be thought of as hyperlinks: they give the unique 
    address of another document, but they do not load it or automatically follow
    the link/reference.  
   </para>
   <para>
    A database reference is just a normal associative array, not an instance of
    <classname>MongoDBRef</classname>, so this class is a little different than 
    the other data type classes.  This class contains exclusively static methods 
    for manipulating database references.
