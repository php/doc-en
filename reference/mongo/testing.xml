 <title>Running the Driver's Tests</title>

 <para>
  The PECL package does not come with the tests, but they are available at 
  <link xlink:href="&url.mongodb.github;">Github</link>.  There are two types of
  tests: the PHPUnit tests and the C tests.  
 </para>

 <section>
  <title>PHPUnit Tests</title>
  <para>
   To run the tests, you must download the driver from Github (the tests are in 
   the <literal>tests/</literal> directory).  You'll also need 
   <link xlink:href="&url.phpunit.install;">PHPUnit</link> to run the tests.
   PHPUnit can be installed via PEAR (although you should look at the 
   installation instructions, it requires a couple of prerequisites).
  </para>
  <para>
   Some tests expect warnings or errors, so you must set 
   <literal>error_reporting</literal> in <literal>php.ini</literal> to 
   <literal>E_STRICT | E_ALL</literal> for these tests to pass.  If you do
   not, you will get some failures that say the test was expecting a warning or
   error.
  </para>
  <para>
   To run the tests, make sure that there is a MongoDB server running locally on
   port 27017.  Before reporting errors, please try running the tests against the
   latest development version of MongoDB: often there are tests for features that
   aren't yet in the stable release. 
  </para>
  <para>
   The test suite uses the "phpunit" database.  If you are using a database 
   called "phpunit" in your application, make sure point MongoDB at a different
   data directory before running the tests. 
  </para>
  <para>
   Make sure you're in the main directory of the driver source you
   downloaded from Github.  Run:

 <section>
  <title>C Tests</title>
  <para>
   The C tests mostly check internal functions that are not exposed through PHP.
   If you'd like to run these tests, you'll need to compile PHP with the 
   <literal>--enable-embed</literal> flag.  Then switch to the 
   <filename>tests</filename> directory and run <literal>make</literal>.  This
   will create a binary called <literal>unit</literal>.  Run 
   <literal>unit</literal> to execute the tests.  These tests do no require a
   database to be running.
  </para>

  <para>
   If a test passes, it will print a ".".  If a test fails, it will assert and
   stop the tests.  Please report any asserts.
  </para>

  <para>
   If <literal>make</literal> cannot find your PHP embedded library (libphp5.so)
   or header files, you may have to specify the <literal>PHP_PATH</literal> 
   variable.
  </para>

  <para>
   Run <literal>make clean</literal> to remove all testing objects.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you run these tests with <filename>valgrind</filename>, you should get no
   invalid memory access errors and the "no leaks are possible" message at the 
   end.
  </para>
 </section>

 <section>
  <title>Reporting Errors</title>
  <para>
   Please report any failures or errors in the 
   <link xlink:href="&url.mongodb.jira;">bugtracker</link>.  There may be skipped 
   tests, these are normal and can be ignored.
  </para>
  <para>
   New tests are always welcome!  Please feel free to contribute new tests of any
   type testing any functionality.
