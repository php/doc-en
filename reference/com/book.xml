   COM is an acronym for Component Object Model; it is an object orientated
   layer (and associated services) on top of DCE RPC (an open standard) and
   defines a common calling convention that enables code written in any
   language to call and interoperate with code written in any other language
   (provided those languages are COM aware).  Not only can the code be
   written in any language, but it need not even be part of the same
   executable; the code can be loaded from a DLL, be found in another
   process running on the same machine, or, with DCOM (Distributed COM), be
   found in another process on a remote machine, all without your code even
   needing to know where a component resides.
  </para>
  <para>
   There is a subset of COM known as OLE Automation which comprises a set of
   COM interfaces that allow loose binding to COM objects, so that they can
   be introspected and called at run-time without compile-time knowledge of
   how the object works.  The PHP COM extension utilizes the OLE
   Automation interfaces to allow you to create and call compatible objects
   from your scripts.  Technically speaking, this should really be called
   the "OLE Automation Extension for PHP", since not all COM objects are OLE
   compatible.
  </para>
  <para>
   Now, why would or should you use COM?  COM is one of the main ways to glue
   applications and components together on the Windows platform; using COM
   you can launch Microsoft Word, fill in a document template and save the
   result as a Word document and send it to a visitor of your web site.  You
   can also use COM to perform administrative tasks for your network and to
   configure your IIS; these are just the most common uses; you can do much
   more with COM.
  </para>
  <para>
   Starting with PHP 5, this extension (and this documentation) was
   rewritten from scratch and much of the old confusing and bogus cruft has
   be removed.  Additionally, we support the instantiation and creation of
   .Net assemblies using the COM interoperability layer provided by
   Microsoft.
