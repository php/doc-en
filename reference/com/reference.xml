     COM is a technology which allows the reuse of code written in any
     language (by any language) using a standard calling convention and hiding
     behind APIs the implementation details such as what machine the Component is
     stored on and the executable which houses it. It can be thought of as a super
     Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism with some basic object roots. It
     separates implementation from interface.

    <para>
     COM encourages versioning, separation of implementation from
     interface and hiding the implementation details such as executable location and
     the language it was written in.
