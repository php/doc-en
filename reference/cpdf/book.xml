   <para>
    ClibPDF support is deprecated and users are strongly encouraged to use
    an alternative, like <link linkend="book.haru">Haru</link>,
    <link linkend="book.pdf">PDFlib</link>, or one of the available
    <link linkend="faq.using.freepdf">PHP alternatives.</link>
   </para>
  </warning>
  <para>
   ClibPDF lets you create PDF documents with PHP. ClibPDF functionality
   and API are similar to <link linkend="book.pdf">PDFlib</link>.
   This documentation should be read alongside the ClibPDF manual since it
   explains the library in much greater detail.
  </para>
  <para>
   Many functions in the native ClibPDF and the PHP module, as well
   as in <link linkend="book.pdf">PDFlib</link>, have the same name.
   All functions except for <function>cpdf_open</function> take the
   handle for the document as their first parameter.
  </para>
  <para>
   Currently this handle is not used internally since ClibPDF does
   not support the creation of several PDF documents at the same time.
   Actually, you should not even try it, the results are unpredictable. I
   can't oversee what the consequences in a multi threaded environment
   are. According to the author of ClibPDF this will change in one of
   the next releases (current version when this was written is 1.10).
   If you need this functionality use the pdflib module.
  </para>
  <para>
   A nice feature of ClibPDF (and <link
   linkend="book.pdf">PDFlib</link>) is the ability to create the pdf
   document completely in memory without using temporary files. It
   also provides the ability to pass coordinates in a predefined unit
   length. (This feature can also be simulated by
   <function>pdf_translate</function> when using the <link
   linkend="book.pdf">PDFlib</link> functions.)
  </para>
  <para>
   Another nice feature of ClibPDF is the fact that any page can be modified
   at any time even if a new page has been already opened. The function
   <function>cpdf_set_current_page</function> allows to leave the current
   page and presume modifying an other page.
  </para>
  <para>
   Most of the functions are fairly easy to use. The most difficult part
   is probably creating a very simple PDF document at all. The following
   example should help you to get started. It creates a document
   with one page. The page contains the text "Times-Roman" in an
   outlined 30pt font. The text is underlined.
