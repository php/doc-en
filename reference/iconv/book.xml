   This module contains an interface to iconv character set conversion
   facility. With this module, you can turn a string represented by a local
   character set into the one represented by another character set,
   which may be the Unicode character set. Supported character sets
   depend on the iconv implementation of your system.
   Note that the iconv function on some systems may not work
   as you expect. In such case, it'd be a good idea to install the
   <link xlink:href="&url.libiconv;">GNU libiconv</link> library. It will most
   likely end up with more consistent results.
