     This module contains an interface to iconv character set conversion
     facility. With this module, you can turn a string represented by a local
     character set into the one represented by another character set,
     which may be the Unicode charcter set. Supported character sets
     depend on the iconv implementation of your system.
     Note that the iconv function on some systems may not work
     as you expect. In such case, it'd be a good idea to install the
     <ulink url="&url.libiconv;">GNU libiconv</ulink> library. It will most
     likely end up with more consistent results.

     Since <application>PHP</application> 5.0.0, this extension comes with
     various utility functions that help you to write multilingual
     scripts. Let's have a look at the following sections to explore the new
     features.

     You will need nothing if the system you are using is one of the recent
     POSIX-compliant systems because standard C libraries that are supplied in
     them must provide iconv facility. Otherwise, you have to get the
     <ulink url="&url.libiconv;">libiconv</ulink> library installed in
     your system.
