    <para>
     Counts the number of occurrences of every byte-value (0..255) in
     <parameter>string</parameter> and returns it in various ways.
     The optional parameter <parameter>mode</parameter> default to
     0. Depending on <parameter>mode</parameter>
     <function>count_chars</function> returns one of the following:
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        0 - an array with the byte-value as key and the frequency of
        every byte as value.
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        1 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency greater
        than zero are listed.
       </simpara>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <simpara>
        2 - same as 0 but only byte-values with a frequency equal to
        zero are listed.
       </simpara>
      </listitem> 
      <listitem>
       <simpara> 
        3 - a string containing all used byte-values is returned.

        4 - a string containing all not used byte-values is returned.
