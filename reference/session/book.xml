  <para>
   Session support in PHP consists of a way to preserve certain data
   across subsequent accesses. This enables you to build more
   customized applications and increase the appeal of your web site.
  </para>
  <para>
   A visitor accessing your web site is assigned a unique id, the
   so-called session id. This is either stored in a cookie on the
   user side or is propagated in the URL.
  </para>
  <para>
   The session support allows you to register arbitrary numbers of
   variables to be preserved across requests. When a visitor accesses
   your site, PHP will check automatically (if <link 
   linkend="ini.session.auto-start">session.auto_start</link>
   is set to 1) or on your request (explicitly through
   <function>session_start</function> or implicitly through
   <function>session_register</function>) whether a specific session
   id has been sent with the request. If this is the case, the prior
   saved environment is recreated.
  </para>
  <caution>
   <para>
    If you turn on <link linkend="ini.session.auto-start">
    session.auto_start</link> then the only way to put objects 
    into your sessions is to load its class definition using 
    <link linkend="ini.auto-prepend-file">auto_prepend_file</link> 
    in which you load the class definition else you will have to 
    <function>serialize</function> your object 
    and <function>unserialize</function> it  
    afterwards.
   </para>
  </caution>
  <para>
   All registered variables are serialized after the request
   finishes.  Registered variables which are undefined are marked as
   being not defined.  On subsequent accesses, these are not defined
   by the session module unless the user defines them later.
  </para>
  <warning>
   <para>
    Some types of data can not be serialized thus stored in sessions. It
    includes <type>resource</type> variables or objects with circular
    references (i.e. objects which passes a reference to itself to another
    object).
   </para>
  </warning>
  <note>
   <para>
    Please note when working with sessions that a record of a session
    is not created until a variable has been registered using the
    <function>session_register</function> function or by adding a new 
    key to the <varname>$_SESSION</varname> superglobal array. This 
    holds true regardless of if a session has been started using the 
    <function>session_start</function> function. 
   </para>
  </note>
  <note>
   <para>
    PHP 5.2.2 introduced an undocumented feature to store session files 
    in "/tmp" even if <link linkend="ini.open-basedir">open_basedir</link> 
    was enabled and "/tmp" is not explicitly added to the allowed paths 
    list. This feature has been removed from PHP as of PHP 5.3.0.
