  HTTP session management represents the core of web security.
  All possible mitigation measures <emphasis>should</emphasis>
  be adopted to ensure sessions are secured.
  Developers should also enable/use applicable security measures.

    <title>Session Security</title>

    <para>
     The session module can not guarantee that the information stored
     in a session is only viewed by the user who created the session.
     Additional measures are needed to protect the confidentiality
     of the session, depending on the value associated with it.
    </para>

    <para>
     The importance of the data carried in the session needs to be
     assessed and further protection may be deployed; this typically
     comes at a price, such as reduced convenience for the user.
     For example, to protect users from a simple social engineering tactic,
     <link linkend="ini.session.use-only-cookies">session.use_only_cookies</link>
     needs to be enabled. In that case, cookies must be enabled
     unconditionally on the client side, or sessions will not work.
    </para>

    <para>
     There are several ways to leak an existing session ID to third
     parties. E.g. JavaScript injections, session IDs in URLs,
     packet sniffing, physical access to the device, etc.
     A leaked session ID enables the third party to access all
     resources associated with a specific ID. First, URLs carrying
     session IDs. If there are links to an external site or resource,
     the URL including the session ID might be stored in the external
     site's referrer logs. Second, a more active attacker might listen
     to network traffic. If it is unencrypted, session IDs will flow
     in plain text over the network. The solution is to implement
     SSL/TLS on the server and make it mandatory for users.
     HSTS should be used for improved security.
   </para>

   <note>
    <simpara>
     Even HTTPS can not protect confidential data at all times.
     For example the CRIME and Beast vulnerabilities may enable an
     attacker to read the data. Also, note that many networks employ
     HTTPS MITM proxies for audit purposes.
     Attackers may also set up such a proxy.

  <sect2 xml:id="features.session.security.management.non-adaptive-session">
   <title>Non-adaptive Session Management</title>

   <para>
    PHP's session manager is adaptive by default currently.
    An adaptive session manager bears additional risks.
   </para>

   <para>
    When <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link> is enabled, 
    and the session save handler supports it,
    an uninitialized session ID is rejected and a new one is created.
    This prevents an attack that forces users to use a known session ID.
    An attacker may paste links or send emails that contains the session ID.
    E.g. <literal>http://example.com/page.php?PHPSESSID=123456789</literal> if
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-trans-sid">session.use_trans_sid</link>
    is enabled, the victim will start a session using the session ID provided
    by the attacker.
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
    mitigate this risk.
   </para>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     User defined save handlers can also support strict session mode by
     implementing session ID validation. All user defined save handlers
     should implement session ID validation.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

   <para>
    The session ID cookie may be set with the domain, path, httponly,
    secure and, as of PHP 7.3, SameSite attributes.
    <!-- Not exactly sure what the meaning here is - girgias -->
    There is precedence defined by browsers.
    By using the precedence, an attacker can set session ID that
    could be used permanently. Use of
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-only-cookies">session.use_only_cookies</link>
    will not solve this issue.
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
    mitigates this risk. With
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>=On,
    the uninitialized session ID will be refused.
   </para>

   <note>
    <simpara>
     Even though
     <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
     mitigates the risk of adaptive session management, an attacker can force
     users to use an initialized session ID which has been created by an attacker.
     E.g. JavaScript injection.
     This attack can be mitigated by this manual's recommendations.
    </simpara>

    <simpara>
     By following this manual, developers should enable,
     <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>,
     use timestamp based session management, and regenerate session IDs using
     <function>session_regenerate_id</function> with recommended procedures.
     If developers follow all of the above, an attacker generated session ID
     will eventually be deleted.
    </simpara>

    <simpara>
     When access to an obsolete session occurs, developers should save all
     active session data of the user. As this information will be relevant
     for an ensuing investigation. The user should be forcefully logged out
     of all sessions, i.e. require them to reauthenticate.
     This prevents attackers from abusing stolen sessions.
    </simpara>
   </note>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     Access to an obsolete session does not necessarily suggest an attack.
     An unstable network and/or immediate deletion of the active session
     will result in legitimate users using obsolete sessions.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

   <para>
    As of PHP 7.1.0, <function>session_create_id</function> has been added.
    This function may be operated to access all active sessions of a user
    efficiently by prefixing the session IDs with the user ID. Enabling
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
    is vital with this setup. Otherwise, malicious users can set
    malicious session ID for other users.
   </para>

   <note>
    <simpara>
     Users prior to PHP 7.1.0 <emphasis>should</emphasis> use
     <acronym>CSPRNG</acronym>, e.g. <filename>/dev/urandom</filename>, or
     <function>random_bytes</function> and hash functions to generate
     a new session ID. <function>session_create_id</function> has
     collision detection and generates a session ID according to the
     session's INI settings.
     Use of <function>session_create_id</function> is preferred.
    </simpara>
   </note>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="features.session.security.management.session-id-regeneration">
   <title>Session ID Regeneration</title>

   <para>
    <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
    is a good mitigation, however not sufficient. Developers must equally use
    <function>session_regenerate_id</function> for session security.
   </para>

   <para>
    Session ID regeneration reduces the risk of stolen session IDs, thus
    <function>session_regenerate_id</function> must be called periodically.
    E.g. Regenerate the session ID every 15 minutes for security sensitive content.
    Even in the case that a session ID is stolen, both the legitimate
    user's and the attacker's session will expire.
    In other words access by the user or the attacker will
    generate an obsolete session access error.
   </para>

   <para>
    Session IDs <emphasis>must</emphasis> be regenerated when user privileges
    are elevated, such as after authenticating.
    <function>session_regenerate_id</function> must be called prior to
    setting the authentication information to <varname>$_SESSION</varname>.
    (<function>session_regenerate_id</function> saves the current session data
    automatically in order to save timestamp/etc. to the current session.)
    Ensure only the new session contains the authenticated flag.
   </para>

   <para>
    Developers <emphasis>must not</emphasis> rely on session ID expiration by
    <link linkend="ini.session.gc-maxlifetime">session.gc_maxlifetime</link>.
    Attackers may access a victim's session ID periodically to prevent its
    expiration and keep exploiting it, including an authenticated session.
   </para>

   <para>
     Instead, developers must implement timestamp based session data management.
   </para>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     Although the session manager can manage timestamps transparently,
     this feature is not implemented. Old session data must be kept until GC.
     Simultaneously, developers must assure themselves obsolete session data
     is removed. However, developers must not remove active session data immediately.
     I.e. <code>session_regenerate_id(true);</code> and
     <function>session_destroy</function> must never be called together for an active session.
     This may sound contradictory, but this is a mandatory requirement.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

   <para>
    <function>session_regenerate_id</function> does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    delete outdated sessions by default.
    Obsolete authenticated sessions may be present for use.
    Developers must prevent outdated sessions to be consumed by anyone.
    They must prohibit access to obsolete session data by themselves using timestamps.
   </para>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     The sudden removal of an active session produces undesirable side effects.
     Sessions can vanish when there are concurrent connections to the web
     application and/or the network is unstable.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     Potential malicious access is undetectable with the sudden removal of active sessions.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     Instead of deleting outdated sessions immediately, developers must set a
     short-term expiration time (timestamp) in <varname>$_SESSION</varname>,
     and prohibit access to the session data by themselves.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     Developers must not prohibit access to old session data immediately after
     <function>session_regenerate_id</function>. It must be prohibited at a
     later stage. E.g. a few seconds later for stable networks, like a wired network,
     and a few minutes later for unstable networks such as cell phones or Wi-Fi.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     If a user accesses an obsolete session (expired session), access to it should be denied.
     It is also recommended to remove the authenticated status from all of the user's
     sessions to as it is likely to represent an attack.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

   <para>
    Proper use of <link linkend="ini.session.use-only-cookies">session.use_only_cookies</link>
    and <function>session_regenerate_id</function> can cause personal DoS with
    undeletable cookies set by attackers. In this case, developers may invite users
    to remove cookies and advise them they may be affected by a security issue.
    Attackers may set malicious cookies via a vulnerable web application,
    an exposed/vicious browser plugin, a physically compromised device, etc.
   </para>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     Do not misunderstand the DoS risk.
     <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>=On
     is mandatory for general session ID security! All sites are advised to enable
     <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     DoS can only happen when the account is under attack. A JavaScript injection
     vulnerability in an application represents the most common cause.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="features.session.security.management.session-data-deletion">
   <title>Session Data Deletion</title>

   <para>
    Obsolete session data must be inaccessible and deleted.
    The current session module does not handle this well.
   </para>

   <para>
    Obsolete session data should be removed as soon as possible.
    However, active sessions must not be removed instantly.
    To satisfy those requirements, developers must implement timestamp
    based session data management by themselves.
   </para>

   <para>
    Set and manage expiration timestamp in $_SESSION.
    Prohibit access to outdated session data.
    When access to obsolete session data is detected, it is advised to remove all 
    authenticated status from the user's sessions and force them to re-authenticate.
    Access to obsolete session data can represent an attack.
    To achieve this, developers must keep track of all active sessions of every user.
   </para>

   <note>
    <simpara>
     Access to an obsolete session can also happen because of an unstable network
     and/or concurrent access to the website.
     E.g. the server tried to set a new session ID via a cookie, but the Set-Cookie
     packet may not have reached the client due to loss of connection.
     One connection may issue a new session ID by <function>session_regenerate_id</function>,
     but another concurrent connection may not have received the new session ID yet.
     Therefore, developers must prohibit access to obsolete session at a later stage.
     I.e. timestamp based session management is mandatory.
    </simpara>
   </note>

   <para>
    In summary, session data must not be destroyed with
    <function>session_regenerate_id</function> nor <function>session_destroy</function>,
    but timestamps must be used to control access to session data.
    Let <function>session_gc</function> remove obsolete data from the session data storage.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="features.session.security.management.session-locking">
   <title>Session and Locking</title>

   <para>
    Session data is locked to avoid race conditions by default.
    Locking is mandatory to keep session data consistent across requests.
   </para>

   <para>
    However, session-locking can be abused by attackers to perform DoS attacks.
    To mitigate the risk of a DoS attack by session-locking, minimize locks.
    Use read only sessions when session data does not need to be updated.
    Use the 'read_and_close' option with <function>session_start</function>.
    <code>session_start(['read_and_close'=>1]);</code>
    Close the session as soon as possible after updating $_SESSION by
    using <function>session_commit</function>.
   </para>

   <para>
    The current session module does <emphasis>not</emphasis>
    detect any modification of $_SESSION when the session is inactive.
    It is the developer's responsibility not to modify $_SESSION when
    the session is inactive.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="features.session.security.management.active-sessions">
   <title>Active Sessions</title>

   <para>
    Developers should keep track of all active sessions for every user.
    And notify them of how many active sessions, from which IP (and area),
    how long it has been active, etc.
    PHP does not keep track of these. Developers are supposed to do so.
   </para>

   <para>
    Various ways to implement this exist.
    One possible implementation is setting up a database that keeps track
    of the required data and stores any relevant information.
    Since session data is GCed, developers must take care of the GCed data
    to maintain the active session database consistency.
   </para>

   <para>
    One of the simplest implementations is "User ID prefixed session ID"
    and store the required information in $_SESSION.
    Many databases posses good performance for selecting string prefix.
    Developers MAY use <function>session_regenerate_id</function> and
    <function>session_create_id</function> for this.
   </para>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     Never employ confidential data as a prefix.
     If the user ID is confidential, consider using
     <function>hash_hmac</function>.

   </warning>

   <warning>
    <simpara>
     Enabling <link linkend="ini.session.use-strict-mode">session.use_strict_mode</link>
     is mandatory for this setup. Ensure it is enabled.
     Otherwise, the active session database can be compromised.
    </simpara>
   </warning>

   <para>
    Timestamp based session management is mandatory to detect access to obsolete sessions.
    When access to an obsolete session is detected, authentication flags should
    be removed from all active sessions of the user.
    This prevents attackers to keep exploiting stolen sessions.

   <para>
    Use a secure one time hash key as an auto-login key using

   <para>
    If the user is unauthenticated, check whether the one-time auto-login key is valid or not.
    In the case it is valid, authenticate the user and set a new secure one-time hash key.
    An auto-login key must only be used once, i.e. never reuse an auto-login key,
    always generate a new one.
   </para>

   <para>
    An auto-login key is a long life authentication key,
    it should be protected as much as possible.
    Use path/httponly/secure/SameSite cookie attributes to secure it.

      This prevents the session module to use an uninitialized session ID.

      Due to the cookie specification, attackers are capable to place

      The <function>session_gc</function> function should be executed by a task
      managers. E.g. cron on UNIX like systems.
     </para>
     <para>
      GC is performed by probability by default.
      This setting does <emphasis>not</emphasis> guarantee that an outdated
      session is deleted.
      Although developers cannot rely on this setting,
      specifying it to the smallest possible value is recommended.
      Adjusting <link
      linkend="ini.session.gc-probability">session.gc_probability</link>
      and <link
      linkend="ini.session.gc-divisor">session.gc_divisor</link> so
      that obsolete sessions are deleted at an appropriate frequency.
      If an auto-login feature is required, developers must implement their own
      secure auto-login feature, see above for more information.
      Never use long life session ID for this feature.

       Some session save handler modules do not use this setting for probability
       based expiration. E.g. memcached, memcache.
       Refer to the session save handler documentation for details.

      Use of a transparent session ID management is not prohibited.
      Developers may employ it when it is required.
      However, disabling transparent session ID management improves the general session
      ID security by eliminating the possibility of a session ID injection and/or leak.

     </para>
     <para>
      (PHP 7.1.0 &gt;=) Developers should not rewrite unneeded HTML tags.
      Default value should be sufficient for most usages.
      Older PHP versions use

     <para>
      (PHP 7.1.0 &gt;=) This INI defines whitelist hosts that allows trans sid rewrite.
      Never add untrusted hosts.
      Session module only allows <literal>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</literal>
      when this setting is empty.

      When <link

      It reduces the risk of session ID injection.
      If a website is <literal>http://example.com/</literal>,
      set <literal>http://example.com/</literal> to it.
      Note that with HTTPS browsers will not send the referrer header.
      Browsers may not send the referrer header by configuration.
      Therefore, this setting is not a reliable security measure.
      Use of this setting is recommended.

      Ensure HTTP content are uncached for authenticated sessions.
      Allow caching only when the content is not private.
      Otherwise, content may be exposed.
      <literal>"private"</literal> may be employed if HTTP content does not
      include security sensitive data.
      Note that <literal>"private"</literal> may transmit private data
      cached by shared clients.
      <literal>"public"</literal> must only be used when HTTP content does
      not contain any private data at all.

     <para>
      (PHP 7.1.0 &lt;) A stronger hash function will generate a stronger session ID.
      Although hash collision is unlikely even with the MD5 hashing algorithm,
      developers should use SHA-2 or a stronger hashing algorithm like sha384 and sha512.
      Developers must ensure they feed a long enough

      If this is set to a world-readable directory, such as

      files in that directory.
