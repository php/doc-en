  <para>
   The PDF functions in PHP can create PDF files using the PDFlib
   library which was initially created by Thomas Merz and is now
   maintained by <link xlink:href="&url.pdf;">PDFlib GmbH</link>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The documentation in this section is only meant to be an overview
   of the available functions in the PDFlib library and should not be
   considered an exhaustive reference. For the full and detailed 
   explanation of each function, consult the PDFlib Reference Manual
   which is included in all PDFlib packages distributed by PDFlib GmbH.
   It provides a very good overview of what PDFlib is capable of doing
   and contains the most up-to-date documentation of all functions.
  </para>
  <para>
   For a jump start we urge you to take a look at the programming samples
   which are contained in all PDFlib distribution packages. These samples
   demonstrate basic text, vector, and graphics output as well as 
   higher-level functions, such as the PDF import facility (PDI).
  </para>
  <para>
   All of the functions in PDFlib and the PHP module have identical
   function names and parameters. Unless configured otherwise, all
   lengths and coordinates are measured in PostScript points. There are
   generally 72 PostScript points to an inch, but this depends on the 
   output resolution. Please see the PDFlib Reference Manual
   included in the PDFlib distribution for a more thorough explanation
   of the coordinate system used.
  </para>
  <para>
   With version 6, PDFlib offers an object-oriented API for PHP 5 in 
   addition to the function-oriented API for PHP 4. The main difference is
   the following:
  </para>
  <para>
   In PHP 4, first a PDF resource has to be retrieved with a function call
   like 
  </para>
  <para>
   $p = PDF_new().
  </para>
  <para>
   This PDF resource is used as the first parameter in all further function
   calls, such as in
  </para>
  <para>
   PDF_begin_document($p, "", "").
  </para>
  <para>
   In PHP 5 however, a PDFlib object is created with
  </para>
  <para>
   $p = new PDFlib().
  </para>
  <para>
   This object offers all PDFlib API functions as methods, e.g. as with
  </para>
  <para>
   $p->begin_document("", "").
  </para>
  <para>
   In addition, exceptions have been introduced in PHP 5 which are
   supported by PDFlib 6 and later as well.
