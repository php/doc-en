     PHP supports libcurl, a library created by Daniel Stenberg, that
     allows you to connect and communicate to many different types of
     servers with many different types of protocols. libcurl currently
     supports the http, https, ftp, gopher, telnet, dict, file, and
     ldap protocols. libcurl also supports HTTPS certificates, HTTP
     POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading (this can also be done with PHP's
     ftp extension), HTTP form based upload, proxies, cookies, and
     user+password authentication.

     These functions have been added in PHP 4.0.2.

     In order to use the CURL functions you need to install the <ulink
     url="&url.curl;">CURL</ulink> package. PHP requires that you use
     CURL 7.0.2-beta or higher. PHP will not work with any version of
     CURL below version 7.0.2-beta. From PHP version 4.2.3 you will atleast
     need CURL version 7.9.0 or higher.

     To use PHP's CURL support you must also compile PHP <option
     role="configure">--with-curl[=DIR]</option> where DIR is the
     location of the directory containing the lib and include
     directories.  In the "include" directory there should be a folder
     named "curl" which should contain the easy.h and curl.h files.
     There should be a file named "libcurl.a" located in the "lib"
     directory.

      In order to enable this module on a Windows environment, you must copy
      <emphasis>libeay32.dll</emphasis> and <emphasis>ssleay32.dll</emphasis>
      from the DLL folder of the PHP/Win32 binary package to the SYSTEM32 
      folder of your windows machine. (Ex: C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32)

     Once you've compiled PHP with CURL support, you can begin using
     the curl functions.  The basic idea behind the CURL functions is
     that you initialize a CURL session using the
     <function>curl_init</function>, then you can set all your
     options for the transfer via the <function>curl_exec</function>
     and then you finish off your session using the
     <function>curl_close</function>.  Here is an example that uses
     the CURL functions to fetch the example.com homepage into a file:
     <example>
      <title>Using PHP's CURL module to fetch the example.com homepage</title>
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$ch = curl_init ("http://www.example.com/");
$fp = fopen ("example_homepage.txt", "w");

curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_FILE, $fp);
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);

curl_exec ($ch);
curl_close ($ch);
fclose ($fp);
?>
