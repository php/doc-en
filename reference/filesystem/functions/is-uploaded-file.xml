    <para>
     Returns &true; if the file named by <parameter>filename</parameter> was
     uploaded via HTTP POST. This is useful to help ensure that a
     malicious user hasn't tried to trick the script into working on
     files upon which it should not be working--for instance,
     <filename>/etc/passwd</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     This sort of check is especially important if there is any chance
     that anything done with uploaded files could reveal their
     contents to the user, or even to other users on the same
     system.

     <function>is_uploaded_file</function> is available only in
     versions of PHP 3 after PHP 3.0.16, and in versions of PHP 4
     after 4.0.2. If you are stuck using an earlier version, you can
     use the following function to help protect yourself:

      <para>
       The following example will <emphasis>not</emphasis> work in
       versions of PHP 4 after 4.0.2. It depends on internal
       functionality of PHP which changed after that version.
