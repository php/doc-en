     MCAL stands for Modular Calendar Access Library.
    </para>
    <para>
     Libmcal is a C library for accessing calendars. It's written to be
     very modular, with pluggable drivers. MCAL is the calendar
     equivalent of the IMAP module for mailboxes.
    </para>
    <para>
     With mcal support, a calendar stream can be opened much like the
     mailbox stream with the IMAP support. Calendars can be local file
     stores, remote ICAP servers, or other formats that are supported
     by the mcal library.
    </para>
    <para>
     Calendar events can be pulled up, queried, and stored. There is
     also support for calendar triggers (alarms) and recurring events.
    </para>
    <para>
     With libmcal, central calendar servers can be accessed,
     removing the need for any specific database or local file
     programming.
    </para>
    <para>
     Most of the functions use an internal event structure that is
     unique for each stream. This alleviates the need to pass around
     large objects between functions. There are convenience functions
     for setting, initializing, and retrieving the event structure
     values.
    </para>
    <note>
     <para>
      PHP had an ICAP extension previously, but the original library
      and the PHP extension is not supported anymore. The suggested
      replacement is MCAL.
