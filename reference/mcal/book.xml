   MCAL stands for Modular Calendar Access Library.
  </para>
  <para>
   Libmcal is a C library for accessing calendars. It's written to be
   very modular, with pluggable drivers. MCAL is the calendar
   equivalent of the IMAP module for mailboxes.
  </para>
  <para>
   With mcal support, a calendar stream can be opened much like the
   mailbox stream with the IMAP support. Calendars can be local file
   stores, remote ICAP servers, or other formats that are supported
   by the mcal library.
  </para>
  <para>
   Calendar events can be pulled up, queried, and stored. There is
   also support for calendar triggers (alarms) and recurring events.
  </para>
  <para>
   With libmcal, central calendar servers can be accessed,
   removing the need for any specific database or local file
   programming.
  </para>
  <para>
   Most of the functions use an internal event structure that is
   unique for each stream. This alleviates the need to pass around
   large objects between functions. There are convenience functions
   for setting, initializing, and retrieving the event structure
   values.

   <para>
    PHP had an ICAP extension previously, but the original library
    and the PHP extension is not supported anymore. The suggested
    replacement is MCAL.
