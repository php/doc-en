     These functions interface the CCVS API, allowing you to work
     directly with CCVS from your PHP scripts.  CCVS is <link
     xlink:href="&url.redhat;">RedHat's</link> solution to the "middle-man"
     in credit card processing.  It lets you directly address the
     credit card clearing houses via your *nix box and a modem.  Using
     the CCVS module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
     through CCVS via your PHP Scripts.  The following references will
     outline the process.

    <note>
     <para>
      CCVS has been discontinued by Red Hat and there are no plans
      to issue further keys or support contracts. Those looking for a 
      replacement can consider 
      <link xlink:href="&url.redhat.mcve;">MCVE by Main Street Softworks</link>
      as a potential replacement. It is similar in design and has documented
      PHP support!
     </para>
     <para>
      This extension has been removed from PHP and is no
      longer available as of PHP 4.3.0. If you want to use credit card
      processing features you can use <link linkend="ref.mcve">MCVE</link>
      instead.

     RedHat has discontinued support for CCVS; however, a slightly
