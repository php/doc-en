  To enable CCVS Support in PHP, first verify your CCVS installation
  directory.  You will then need to configure PHP with the <option
  role="configure">--with-ccvs</option> option. If you use this
  option without specifying the path to your CCVS installation, PHP
  will attempt to look in the default CCVS Install location
  (<filename>/usr/local/ccvs</filename>). If CCVS is in a non-standard location,
  run configure with: <option role="configure">--with-ccvs=[DIR]</option>, where
  DIR is the path to your CCVS installation. Please note that CCVS support
  requires that DIR/lib and DIR/include exist, and include
  <filename>cv_api.h</filename> under the include directory and
  <filename>libccvs.a</filename> under the lib directory.
 </para>

  Additionally, a ccvsd process will need to be running for the configurations
  you intend to use in your PHP scripts. You will also need to make sure the PHP
  Processes are running under the same user as your CCVS was installed as (e.g.
  if you installed CCVS as user 'ccvs', your PHP processes must run as 'ccvs' as
  well.)
