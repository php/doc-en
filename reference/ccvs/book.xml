  <para>
   These functions interface the CCVS API, allowing you to work
   directly with CCVS from your PHP scripts.  CCVS is <link
   xlink:href="&url.redhat;">RedHat's</link> solution to the "middle-man"
   in credit card processing.  It lets you directly address the
   credit card clearing houses via your *nix box and a modem.  Using
   the CCVS module for PHP, you can process credit cards directly
   through CCVS via your PHP Scripts.  The following references will
   outline the process.
  </para>
  <warning>
   <para>
    CCVS has been discontinued by Red Hat and there are no plans
    to issue further keys or support contracts. Those looking for a 
    replacement can consider 
    <link xlink:href="&url.redhat.mcve;">MCVE by Main Street Softworks</link>
    as a potential replacement. It is similar in design and has documented
    PHP support!
   </para>
   <para>
    This extension has been removed from PHP and is no
    longer available as of PHP 4.3.0. If you want to use credit card
    processing features you can use <link linkend="book.mcve">MCVE</link>
    instead.
