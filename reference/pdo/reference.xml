     The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface
     for accessing databases in PHP. Each database driver that
     implements the PDO interface can expose database-specific
     features as regular extension functions. Note that you cannot
     perform any database functions using the PDO extension by
     itself; you must use a <link linkend="pdo.drivers">database-specific
     PDO driver</link> to access a database server.
    </para>
    <para>
     PDO provides a <emphasis>data-access</emphasis> abstraction layer, which
     means that, regardless of which database you're using, you use the same
     functions to issue queries and fetch data.  PDO does
     <emphasis>not</emphasis> provide a <emphasis>database</emphasis>
     abstraction; it doesn't rewrite SQL or emulate missing features.  You
     should use a full-blown abstraction layer if you need that facility.

     PDO ships with PHP 5.1, and is available as a PECL extension for PHP 5.0;
     PDO requires the new OO features in the core of PHP 5, and so will not
     run with earlier versions of PHP.

     Connections are established by creating instances of the PDO base class.
     It doesn't matter which driver you want to use; you always use the PDO
     class name. The constructor accepts parameters for specifying the
     database source (known as the DSN) and optionally for the username and
     password (if any).

      If your application does not catch the exception thrown from the PDO
      constructor, the default action taken by the zend engine is to terminate
      the script and display a back trace.  This back trace will likely reveal
      the full database connection details, including the username and
      password.  It is your responsibility to catch this exception, either
      explicitly (via a <literal>catch</literal> statement) or implicitly via

     Upon successful connection to the database, an instance of the PDO class
     is returned to your script.  The connection remains active for the
     lifetime of that PDO object.  To close the connection, you need to
     destroy the object by ensuring that all remaining references to it are
     deleted--you do this by assigning &null; to the variable that holds the
     object.  If you don't do this explicitly, PHP will automatically close
     the connection when your script ends.

    Many web applications will benefit from making persistent connections to
    database servers.  Persistent connections are not closed at the end of the
    script, but are cached and re-used when another script requests a
    connection using the same credentials.  The persistent connection cache
    allows you to avoid the overhead of establishing a new connection every
    time a script needs to talk to a database, resulting in a faster web
    application.

      If you wish to use persistent connections, you must set

      passed to the PDO constructor. If setting this attribute with
      <xref linkend="function.PDO-setAttribute" /> after instantiation of the 
      object, the driver will not use persistent connections.

      If you're using the PDO ODBC driver and your ODBC libraries support ODBC
      Connection Pooling (unixODBC and Windows are two that do; there may be
      more), then it's recommended that you don't use persistent PDO
      connections, and instead leave the connection caching to the ODBC
      Connection Pooling layer.  The ODBC Connection Pool is shared with other
      modules in the process; if PDO is told to cache the connection, then
      that connection would never be returned to the ODBC connection pool,
      resulting in additional connections being created to service those other
      modules.

   <section xml:id='pdo.transactions'>
    <title>Transactions and auto-commit</title>
    <para>
     Now that you're connected via PDO, you must understand how PDO
     manages transactions before you start issuing queries. If you've never
     encountered transactions before, they offer 4 major features: Atomicity,
     Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID). In layman's terms, any work
     carried out in a transaction, even if it is carried out in stages, is
     guaranteed to be applied to the database safely, and without interference
     from other connections, when it is committed. Transactional work can also
     be automatically undone at your request (provided you haven't already
     committed it), which makes error handling in your scripts easier.
    </para>
    <para>
     Transactions are typically implemented by "saving-up" your batch of
     changes to be applied all at once; this has the nice side effect of
     drastically improving the efficiency of those updates. In other words,
     transactions can make your scripts faster and potentially more robust
     (you still need to use them correctly to reap that benefit).
    </para>
    <para>
     Unfortunately, not every database supports transactions, so PDO needs to
     run in what is known as "auto-commit" mode when you first open the
     connection.  Auto-commit mode means that every query that you run has its
     own implicit transaction, if the database supports it, or no transaction
     if the database doesn't support transactions. If you need a transaction,
     you must use the <xref linkend="function.PDO-beginTransaction" /> method to
     initiate one. If the underlying driver does not support transactions, a
     PDOException will be thrown (regardless of your error handling settings:
     this is always a serious error condition). Once you are in a transaction,
     you may use <xref linkend="function.PDO-commit" /> or
     <xref linkend="function.PDO-rollBack" /> to finish it, depending on the success
     of the code you run during the transaction.

    </para>
    <para>
     When the script ends or when a connection is about to be closed, if you
     have an outstanding transaction, PDO will automatically roll it back.
     This is a safety measure to help avoid inconsistency in the cases where
     the script terminates unexpectedly--if you didn't explicitly commit the
     transaction, then it is assumed that something went awry, so the rollback
     is performed for the safety of your data.
    </para>
    <warning>
     <para>
      The automatic rollback only happens if you initiate the transaction via
      <xref linkend="function.PDO-beginTransaction" />. If you manually issue a
      query that begins a transaction PDO has no way of knowing about it and
      thus cannot roll it back if something bad happens.
     </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
     <example><title>Executing a batch in a transaction</title>
      <para>
       In the following sample, let's assume that we are creating a set of
       entries for a new employee, who has been assigned an ID number of 23.
       In addition to entering the basic data for that person, we also need to
       record their salary. It's pretty simple to make two separate updates,
       but by enclosing them within the
       <xref linkend="function.PDO-beginTransaction" /> and
       <xref linkend="function.PDO-commit" /> calls, we are guaranteeing that no one
       else will be able to see those changes until they are complete. If
       something goes wrong, the catch block rolls back all changes made
       since the transaction was started, and then prints out an error
       message.

     You're not limited to making updates in a transaction; you can also issue
     complex queries to extract data, and possibly use that information to
     build up more updates and queries; while the transaction is active, you
     are guaranteed that no one else can make changes while you are in the
     middle of your work. In truth, this isn't 100% correct, but it is a
     good-enough introduction, if you've never heard of transactions before.

   <section xml:id='pdo.prepared-statements'>
    <title>Prepared statements and stored procedures</title>
    <para>
     Many of the more mature databases support the concept of prepared
     statements.  What are they? You can think of them as a kind of compiled
     template for the SQL that you want to run, that can be customized using
     variable parameters.  Prepared statements offer two major benefits:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       The query only needs to be parsed (or prepared) once, but can be
       executed multiple times with the same or different parameters. When the
       query is prepared, the database will analyze, compile and optimize it's
       plan for executing the query. For complex queries this process can take
       up enough time that it will noticeably slow down your application if you
       need to repeat the same query many times with different parameters. By
       using a prepared statement you avoid repeating the
       analyze/compile/optimize cycle. In short, prepared statements use fewer
       resources and thus run faster.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       The parameters to prepared statements don't need to be quoted; the
       driver handles it for you. If your application exclusively uses
       prepared statements, you can be sure that no SQL injection will occur.
       (However, if you're still building up other parts of the query based on
       untrusted input, you're still at risk).
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     Prepared statements are so useful that they are the only feature that PDO
     will emulate for drivers that don't support them.  This ensures that you
     will be able to use the same data access paradigm regardless of the
     capabilities of the database.

    If the database driver supports it, you may also bind parameters for
    output as well as input. Output parameters are typically used to retrieve
    values from stored procedures. Output parameters are slightly more complex
    to use than input parameters, in that you must know how large a given
    parameter might be when you bind it. If the value turns out to be larger
    than the size you suggested, an error is raised.

        This is the default mode. PDO will simply set the error code for you
        to inspect using the <xref linkend="function.PDO-errorCode" /> and
        <xref linkend="function.PDO-errorInfo" /> methods on both the
        statement and database objects; if the error resulted from a call on a
        statement object, you would invoke the
        <xref linkend="function.PDOStatement-errorCode" /> or
        <xref linkend="function.PDOStatement-errorInfo" />
        method on that object. If the error resulted from a call on the
        database object, you would invoke those methods on the database object

        In addition to setting the error code, PDO will emit a traditional
        E_WARNING message. This setting is useful during debugging/testing, if

        flow of the application.

       <para>
        In addition to setting the error code, PDO will throw a
        <classname>PDOException</classname>
        and set its properties to reflect the error code and error
        information. This setting is also useful during debugging, as it will
        effectively "blow up" the script at the point of the error, very
        quickly pointing a finger at potential problem areas in your code
        (remember: transactions are automatically rolled back if the exception
        causes the script to terminate).
       </para>
       <para>
        Exception mode is also useful because you can structure your error
        handling more clearly than with traditional PHP-style warnings, and
        with less code/nesting than by running in silent mode and explicitly
        checking the return value of each database call.

     PDO standardizes on using SQL-92 SQLSTATE error code strings; individual
     PDO drivers are responsible for mapping their native codes to the
     appropriate SQLSTATE codes.   The <xref linkend="function.PDO-errorCode" />
     method returns a single SQLSTATE code. If you need more specific
     information about an error, PDO also offers an
     <xref linkend="function.PDO-errorInfo" /> method which returns an array
     containing the SQLSTATE code, the driver specific error code and driver
     specific error string.

      more", although some databases can happily handle up to 32kb before data becomes
      "large". Large objects can be either textual or binary in nature. PDO

      type code in your <xref linkend="function.PDOStatement-bindParam" /> or
      <xref linkend="function.PDOStatement-bindColumn" /> calls.

      it to the browser using <function>fpassthru</function>.  Since the LOB
      is represented as a stream, functions such as
      <function>fgets</function>, <function>fread</function> and
      <function>stream_get_contents</function> can be used on it.

      This example opens up a file and passes the file handle to PDO to insert

      to the database in the most efficient manner possible.

      Oracle requires a slightly different syntax for inserting a lob from a
      file.  It's also essential that you perform the insert under a
      transaction, otherwise your newly inserted LOB will be committed with a
      zero-length as part of the implicit commit that happens when the query
      is executed:
