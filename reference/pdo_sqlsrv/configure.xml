  The PDO_SQLSRV extension is enabled by adding appropriate DLL file to your PHP 
  extension directory and the corresponding entry to the  &php.ini; file. The 
  PDO_SQLSRV download comes with several driver files. Which driver file you 
  use will depend on 3 factors: the PHP version you are using, whether you are 
  using thread-safe or non-thread-safe PHP, and whether your PHP installation 
  was compiled with the VC6 or VC9 compiler. For example, if you are running 
  PHP 5.3, you are using non-thread-safe PHP, and your PHP installation was 
  compiled with the VC9 compiler, you should use the php_pdo_sqlsrv_53_nts_vc9.dll 
  file. (You should use a non-thread-safe version compiled with the VC9 compiler 
  if you are using IIS as your web server). If you are running PHP 5.2, you are 
  using thread-safe PHP, and your PHP installation was compiled with the VC6 
  compiler, you should use the php_pdo_sqlsrv_52_ts_vc6.dll file.
