 <title>OCI8 Fast Application Notification (FAN) Support</title>
  <para>
   FAN support gives fast connection failover, an Oracle Database high availability
   feature.  This allows PHP OCI8 scripts to be notified when a
   database machine or database instance becomes unavailable.  Without
   FAN, OCI8 can hang until a TCP timeout occurs and an error is
   returned, which might be several minutes.  Enabling FAN in OCI8 can
   allow applications to detect errors and re-connect to an available
   database instance without the web user being aware of an outage.
  </para>
  <para>
   FAN support is available when the Oracle client libraries that PHP
   links with and the Oracle Database are either version 10gR2 or later.
  </para>
  <para>
   FAN benefits users of Oracle's clustering technology (RAC) because
   connections to surviving database instances can be immediately
   made.  Users of Oracle's Data Guard with a broker will see the FAN
   events generated when the standby database goes online.  Standalone
   databases will send FAN events when the database restarts.
  </para>
  <para>
   For active connections, when a machine or database instance becomes
   unavailable, a connection failure error will be returned by the
   OCI8 extension function currently being called.  On a subsequent
   PHP script re-connect, a connection to a surviving database
   instance will be established.  The OCI8 extension also
   transparently cleans up any idle connections affected by a database
   machine or instance failure so PHP connect calls will establish a
   fresh connection without the script being aware of any service
   disruption.
  </para>
  <para>
   When <link linkend="ini.oci8.events">oci8.events</link>
   is <literal>On</literal>, it is suggested to
   set <link linkend="ini.oci8.ping-interval">oci8.ping_interval</link>
   to -1 to disable pinging, since enabling FAN events provide
   pro-active connection management of idle connections made invalid
   by a service disruption.
  </para>
  <para>
   To enable FAN support in PHP OCI8, build PHP OCI8 with Oracle 10gR2 or later
   libraries and then follow these steps:

      As a privileged database administrator, use a program like
      SQL*Plus to enable the database service to post FAN events, for
      example:

     <para>
      <informalexample>
       <screen>
<![CDATA[
    SQL> execute dbms_service.modify_service(
                   SERVICE_NAME        => 'sales',
                   AQ_HA_NOTIFICATIONS => TRUE);
]]>
       </screen>
      </informalexample>
     </para>

     <para>
      <informalexample>
       <screen>
<![CDATA[
    oci8.events = On

      </informalexample>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If the application does not already handle OCI8 error
      conditions, modify it to detect failures and take appropriate
      action.  This may include re-connecting and re-executing
      statements.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Run the application, connecting to Oracle Database 10gR2 or later.
     </simpara>
