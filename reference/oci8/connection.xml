 <title>Connection Handling</title>
 <section>
  <title>Connection Functions</title>
  <para>
   The OCI8 extension provides three different functions for
   connecting to Oracle.  The standard connection function
   is <function>oci_connect</function>.  This creates a connection to
   an Oracle database and returns a resource used by subsequent
   database calls.
  </para>
  <para>
   Connecting to an Oracle server is a reasonably expensive operation
   in terms of the time that it takes to complete.
   The <function>oci_pconnect</function> function uses a persistent
   cache of connections that can be re-used across different script
   requests.  This means that the connection overhead will typically
   only occur once per PHP process (or Apache child).
  </para>
  <para>
   If the application connects to Oracle using a different set of
   credentials for each web user, the persistent cache employed by
   <function>oci_pconnect</function> will become less useful as the
   number of concurrent users increases, to the point where it may
   start to adversely affect the overall performance of the Oracle
   server due to maintaining too many idle connections. If the
   application is structured in this way, it is recommended to either
   tune the application using
   the <link linkend="ini.oci8.max-persistent">oci8.max_persistent</link>
   and <link linkend="ini.oci8.persistent-timeout">oci8.persistent_timeout</link>
   configuration settings (these will give control over the persistent
   connection cache size and lifetime), use Oracle 11g Database
   Resident Connection Pooling, or use
   <function>oci_connect</function> instead.
  </para>
  <para>
   Both <function>oci_connect</function>
   and <function>oci_pconnect</function> employ a connection cache; if
   multiple calls to
   <function>oci_connect</function> use the same parameters in a given
   script, the second and subsequent calls return the existing
   connection handle.  The cache used
   by <function>oci_connect</function> is cleaned up at the end of the
   script run, or when the connection handle is explicitly closed. The
   function <function>oci_pconnect</function> has similar behavior,
   although its cache is maintained separately and survives between
   HTTP requests.  
  </para>
  <para>
   This caching feature means the two handles are not transactionally
   isolated (they are in fact the same connection handle, so there is
   no isolation of any kind).  If the application needs two separate,
   transactionally isolated connections, then
   use <function>oci_new_connect</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <function>oci_pconnect</function> cache is cleared and any
   database connections closed when the PHP process terminates, so
   effective use of persistent connections requires that PHP be an
   Apache module or used with FGCI, or similar.  Persistent connections
   will not have any benefits over <function>oci_connect</function>
   when PHP is used with CGI or via the command-line.
  </para>
  <para>
   The function <function>oci_new_connect</function> always creates a
   new connection to the Oracle server, regardless of what other
   connections might already exist.  High traffic web applications
   should avoid using
   <function>oci_new_connect</function>, especially in the busiest sections of
   the application.
  </para>

 <section>
  <title>DRCP Connection Pooling</title>
  <para>
   PHP 5.3 (PECL OCI8 1.3) supports Oracle 11g Database Resident
   Connection Pooling (DRCP).  DRCP allows more efficient use of
   database machine memory and provides high scalability.  No, or
   minimal, application changes are needed to use DRCP.
  </para>
  <para>
   DRCP is suited for applications that connect using few database
   schemas and hold database connections open for a short period of
   time.  Other applications should use Oracle's
   default <literal>Dedicated</literal> database server processes, or
   use <literal>Shared</literal> servers.
  </para>
  <para>
   DRCP benefits all three connection functions, but gives the highest
   scalability when connections are created
   with <function>oci_pconnect</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For DRCP to be available in OCI8, Oracle client libraries used by
   PHP and the version of the Oracle Database must both be 11g.
  </para>
  <para>
   Documentation on DRCP is found in several Oracle manuals. For
   example,
   see <link xlink:href="&url.oracle.drcp.configure;">Configuring
   Database Resident Connection Pooling</link> in the Oracle
   documentation for usage information.
   A <link xlink:href="&url.oracle.drcp.whitepaper;">DRCP
   white paper</link> contains background information on DRCP.
  </para>
  <para>
   To use DRCP, build PHP with the OCI8 1.3 extension and Oracle 11g
   libraries and then follow these steps:

      modify the tnsnames.ora file and add

       <screen>
<![CDATA[
    MYDB = (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp) (HOST=myhost.dom.com)

           (SERVER=POOLED)))
]]>
       </screen>
      </informalexample>
     </para>
     <para>
      Alternatively, modify the Easy Connect syntax in PHP and add
      <literal>:POOLED</literal> after the service name:
     </para>
     <para>
      <informalexample>
       <screen>
<![CDATA[

     <para>
      Edit &php.ini; and choose a connection class name.  This name
      indicates a logical division of the connection pool and can be
      used to isolate pooling for separate applications.  Any PHP
      applications with the same user name and connection class value
      will be able to share connections in the pool, giving greater
      scalability.

    Applications using Oracle 10g that require the performance of
    persistent connections can reduce the amount of database server

  <title>DRCP Recommendations and Known Limitations</title>
  <para>
   Changing a password over DRCP connections will fail with the error
   <emphasis>ORA-56609: Usage not supported with DRCP</emphasis>.
   This is a documented restriction of Oracle Database 11g.
  </para>
  <para>
   With the OCI8 1.3 extension, persistent connections can now be
   closed by the user, allowing greater control over connection
   resource usage.  Persistent connections will now also be closed
   automatically when there is no PHP variable referencing them, such
   as at the end of scope of a PHP user function.  This will rollback
   any uncommitted transaction.  These changes to persistent
   connections make them behave similarly to non-persistent
   connections, simplifying the interface, allowing for greater
   application consistency and predictability.
   Use <link linkend="ini.oci8.old-oci-close-semantics">oci8.old_oci_close_semantics</link>
   set to
   <emphasis>On</emphasis> to retain the historical behavior.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the Oracle Database is version 11.1.0.6, then the Oracle
   database patch for Oracle bug 6474441 must be applied to use DRCP.
   Without this patch, errors such as <emphasis>ORA-01000: maximum
   open cursors exceeded</emphasis>, <emphasis>ORA-01001 invalid
   cursor</emphasis> or <emphasis>ORA-01002 fetch out of
   sequence</emphasis> may occur.  This bug was fixed in Oracle
   11.1.0.7 onwards.
  </para>
   <para>
   If the Oracle 11.1.0.6 database patch cannot be applied, one of the
   following three workarounds can be used instead:
  </para>
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>

      or <literal>Shared</literal> servers instead of DRCP.

    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Set PHP's <link linkend="ini.oci8.statement-cache-size">oci8.statement_cache_size</link>

    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      Set an event in the database initialization parameter file:
      <emphasis>event="56699 trace name context forever, level 128"</emphasis>.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   Oracle Database 11.1.0.7 and the Oracle Database 11.1.0.6 patch for
   Oracle bug 6474441 allow PHP applications with DRCP connection to
   use a database <literal>LOGON</literal> trigger to set session
   properties at the time of session creation.  Examples of such
   settings are the NLS language and the date format.
  </para>
  <para>
   If the Oracle 11.1.0.6 database patch cannot be applied, one of the
   following workarounds can be used instead
   of using <literal>LOGON</literal> triggers:
  </para>
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      After logon, explicitly set the session properties using PHP
      application code.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>

      Connect using Oracle <literal>Dedicated</literal>
      or <literal>Shared</literal> servers instead of DRCP.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>
  <para>
   The automatic re-establishment of PHP persistent connections after
   an Apache or FGCI process respawns means <literal>LOGON</literal>
   triggers in PHP are only recommended for setting session attributes
   and not for per-application user connection requests.  This is even
   more so with DRCP due to the automatic pool sizing and with the
   way <literal>LOGON</literal> triggers fire with DRCP
   authentication.
  </para>

 <section>
  <title>Fast Application Notification (FAN) Support</title>
  <para>
   FAN support gives fast connection failover, a high availability
   feature.  This allows PHP OCI8 scripts to be notified when a
   database machine or database instance becomes unavailable.  Without
   FAN, OCI8 can hang until a TCP timeout occurs and an error is
   returned, which might be several minutes.  Enabling FAN in OCI8 can
   allow applications to detect errors and re-connect to an available
   database instance without the web user being aware of an outage.
  </para>
  <para>
   FAN support is available when the Oracle client libraries that PHP
   links with and the Oracle Database are either version 10gR2 or 11g.
  </para>
  <para>
   FAN benefits users of Oracle's clustering technology (RAC) because
   connections to surviving database instances can be immediately
   made.  Users of Oracle's Data Guard with a broker will see the FAN
   events generated when the standby database goes online.  Standalone
   databases will send FAN events when the database restarts.
  </para>
  <para>
   For active connections, when a machine or database instance becomes
   unavailable, a connection failure error will be returned by the
   OCI8 extension function currently being called.  On a subsequent
   PHP script re-connect, a connection to a surviving database
   instance will be established.  The OCI8 extension also
   transparently cleans up any idle connections affected by a database
   machine or instance failure so PHP connect calls will establish a
   fresh connection without the script being aware of any service
   disruption.
  </para>
  <para>
   When <link linkend="ini.oci8.events">oci8.events</link>
   is <literal>On</literal>, it is suggested to
   set <link linkend="ini.oci8.ping-interval">oci8.ping_interval</link>
   to -1 to disable pinging, since enabling FAN events provide
   pro-active connection management of idle connections made invalid
   by a service disruption.
  </para>
  <para>
   To enable FAN support in PHP, build PHP with Oracle 10gR2 or 11g
   libraries and then follow these steps:
  </para>
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      As a privileged database administrator, use a program like
      SQL*Plus to enable the database service to post FAN events, for
