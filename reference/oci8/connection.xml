 <title>OCI8 Connection Handling and Connection Pooling</title>
 <section>
  <title>Connection Functions</title>
  <para>
   The OCI8 extension provides three different functions for
   connecting to Oracle.  The standard connection function
   is <function>oci_connect</function>.  This creates a connection to
   an Oracle database and returns a resource used by subsequent
   database calls.
  </para>
  <para>
   Connecting to an Oracle server is a reasonably expensive operation
   in terms of the time that it takes to complete.
   The <function>oci_pconnect</function> function uses a persistent
   cache of connections that can be re-used across different script
   requests.  This means that the connection overhead will typically
   only occur once per PHP process (or Apache child).
  </para>
  <para>
   If the application connects to Oracle using a different set of database
   credentials for each web user, the persistent cache employed by
   <function>oci_pconnect</function> will become less useful as the
   number of concurrent users increases, to the point where it may
   start to adversely affect the overall performance of the Oracle
   server due to maintaining too many idle connections. If the
   application is structured in this way, it is recommended to either
   tune the application using
   the <link linkend="ini.oci8.max-persistent">oci8.max_persistent</link>
   and <link linkend="ini.oci8.persistent-timeout">oci8.persistent_timeout</link>
   configuration settings (these will give control over the persistent
   connection cache size and lifetime), use Oracle Database
   Resident Connection Pooling (in Oracle Database 11g or later), or use
   <function>oci_connect</function> instead.
  </para>
  <para>
   Both <function>oci_connect</function>
   and <function>oci_pconnect</function> employ a connection cache; if
   multiple calls to
   <function>oci_connect</function> use the same parameters in a given
   script, the second and subsequent calls return the existing
   connection handle.  The cache used
   by <function>oci_connect</function> is cleaned up at the end of the
   script run, or when the connection handle is explicitly closed. The
   function <function>oci_pconnect</function> has similar behavior,
   although its cache is maintained separately and survives between
   HTTP requests.  
  </para>
  <para>
   This caching feature means the two handles are not transactionally
   isolated (they are in fact the same connection handle, so there is
   no isolation of any kind).  If the application needs two separate,
   transactionally isolated connections, then
   use <function>oci_new_connect</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <function>oci_pconnect</function> cache is cleared and any
   database connections closed when the PHP process terminates, so
   effective use of persistent connections requires that PHP be an
   Apache module or used with FPM, or similar.  Persistent connections
   will not have any benefits over <function>oci_connect</function>
   when PHP is used with CGI or via the command-line.
  </para>
  <para>
   The function <function>oci_new_connect</function> always creates a
   new connection to the Oracle server, regardless of what other
   connections might already exist.  High traffic web applications
   should avoid using
   <function>oci_new_connect</function>, especially in the busiest sections of
   the application.
  </para>
  <para>
   From OCI8 1.3, persistent connections can be
   closed by the user, allowing greater control over connection
   resource usage.  Persistent connections will now also be closed
   automatically when there is no PHP variable referencing them, such
   as at the end of scope of a PHP user function.  This will rollback
   any uncommitted transaction.  These changes to persistent
   connections make them behave similarly to non-persistent
   connections, simplifying the interface, allowing for greater
   application consistency and predictability.
   Use <link linkend="ini.oci8.old-oci-close-semantics">oci8.old_oci_close_semantics</link>
   set to
   <emphasis>On</emphasis> to retain the historical behavior.
  </para>
  <para>
   The automatic re-establishment of PHP persistent connections after an Apache
   or FPM process respawns means Oracle Database <literal>LOGON</literal>
   triggers are only recommended for setting session attributes and not for
   per-application user connection requests.
  </para>

  <title>DRCP Connection Pooling</title>
  <para>
   PHP from 5.3 (PECL OCI8 1.3) supports Oracle Database Resident
   Connection Pooling (DRCP).  DRCP allows more efficient use of
   database machine memory and provides high scalability.  No, or
   minimal, application changes are needed to use DRCP.
  </para>
  <para>
   DRCP is suited for applications that connect using few database
   schemas and hold database connections open for a short period of
   time.  Other applications should use Oracle's
   default <literal>Dedicated</literal> database server processes, or
   use <literal>Shared</literal> servers.
  </para>
  <para>
   DRCP benefits all three connection functions, but gives the highest
   scalability when connections are created
   with <function>oci_pconnect</function>.
  </para>
  <para>
   For DRCP to be available in OCI8, Oracle client libraries used by
   PHP and the version of the Oracle Database must both be 11g or greater.
  </para>
  <para>
   Documentation on DRCP is found in several Oracle manuals. For
   example,
   see <link xlink:href="&url.oracle.drcp.configure;">Configuring
   Database Resident Connection Pooling</link> in the Oracle
   documentation for usage information.
   A <link xlink:href="&url.oracle.drcp.whitepaper;">DRCP
   white paper</link> contains background information on DRCP.
  </para>
  <para>
   To use DRCP, install the OCI8 1.3 (or later) extension and Oracle 11g (or later)
   libraries and then follow these steps:

      As a privileged database administrator, use a program like
      SQL*Plus to start the connection pool in the database:

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Optionally
      use <literal>dbms_connection_pool.alter_param()</literal> to
      configure DRCP settings.  The current pool settings can be
      queried from the <literal>DBA_CPOOL_INFO</literal> view.

      Update the connection strings used.  For PHP applications that
      currently connect using a Network Connect Name
      like <literal>MYDB</literal>:

     </para>
     <para>
      modify the tnsnames.ora file and add
      a <literal>(SERVER=POOLED)</literal> clause, for example:
     </para>
     <para>
      <informalexample>
       <screen>
<![CDATA[
    MYDB = (DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=tcp) (HOST=myhost.dom.com)
           (PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=sales)
           (SERVER=POOLED)))
]]>
       </screen>
      </informalexample>
     </para>
     <para>
      Alternatively, modify the Easy Connect syntax in PHP and add
      <literal>:POOLED</literal> after the service name:
     </para>
     <para>
      <informalexample>
       <screen>
<![CDATA[
    $c = oci_pconnect("myuser", "mypassword", "myhost.dom.com:1521/sales:POOLED");
]]>

      </informalexample>
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Edit &php.ini; and choose a connection class name.  This name
      indicates a logical division of the connection pool and can be
      used to isolate pooling for separate applications.  Any PHP
      applications with the same user name and connection class value
      will be able to share connections in the pool, giving greater
      scalability.

<![CDATA[
    oci8.connection_class = "MY_APPLICATION_NAME"

   <para>
    Applications using Oracle Client libraries 10g that require the performance of
    persistent connections can reduce the amount of database server
    memory needed by using Oracle <literal>Shared</literal> servers
    (previously known as Multi Threaded Servers).  Refer to Oracle
    documentation for information.

   Changing a password over DRCP connections will fail with the error
   <emphasis>ORA-56609: Usage not supported with DRCP</emphasis>.
   This is a documented restriction of Oracle Database 11g.
