 <section xml:id="sca.examples.structure">
  <title>The structure of a Service Component</title>
  <para> 
   A service component is implemented by a class. To identify it
   as a service component, it contains an @service annotation. The SCA
   runtime will use the file name of the script to determine the
   component name, by convention. The class and script file must
   therefore share the same name. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   PHP SCA components always expose a service, and there is no way
   for a component to be invoked other than to be called as a result of a
   Web service request, or called directly from another component or
   from a script. For this reason a valid PHP SCA component will always
   contain an @service annotation and at least one public method.
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   Each SCA Component requires that the SCA.php script is
   included. As well as containing the definition of the SCA class,
   this script contains executable PHP code that will run whenever the
   script is called, and which will be responsible for making the
   component behave as needed. 
  </para>
  
  <caution>
   
   <para> 
    It is very important that if your file contains other
    includes, they come before the include for SCA.php. If there are
    includes after the include for SCA.php, they will not have been
    processed when the SCA runtime runs your class. 
   </para>
  </caution>
  
  <para> 
   The example below illustrates this overall structure

 <!-- {{{ Section Proxies -->
 <section xml:id="sca.examples.proxies">
  <title> Obtaining a proxy for another Service Component </title>
  <para>
   One SCA component can call the service provided by another SCA
   component. The service a component provides is made up of all of its
   public methods. SCA for PHP currently provides two ways for one
   component to call another: either locally (i.e. within the same PHP
   run-time, and on the same call stack) or remotely if the called
   component exposes a Web service binding. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   In order for one component to call another, the calling
   component needs a proxy for the called component. This proxy is
   usually provided as an instance variable in the calling component,
   though proxies can also be obtained with the SCA::getService()
   call, as we shall see later. When a component is constructed,
   proxies are constructed for any instance variable which refer to
   another component, and these proxies are "injected" into the
   instance variables. Proxies are always used, whether the
   component is local or remote, in order to provide identical calling
   behavior between remote and local calls (for example, local calls
   are made to always pass data by-value). The proxies know how to
   locate the required component and to pass the calls made on to them.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   Instance variables which are intended to hold proxies for
   services are indicated by the two PHPDocumentor-style
   annotations, @reference and @binding. Both annotations are
   placed in the documentation section for a class instance variable,
   as shown by the code below. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   The @reference annotation before an instance variable
   indicates that the instance variable is to be initialized with a
   proxy to a component. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   The @binding annotation has two forms @binding.php and
   @binding.soap, and indicates that the proxy is either for a local
   component or for a Web service respectively. For both @binding.php
   and @binding.soap, the annotation gives a target URI. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   At the moment, with the annotation-based method of
   specifying dependencies, the only way to alter the intended target
   of a reference is to alter the annotation within the component.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   In our ConvertedStockQuote example, the
   <varname>$exchange_rate</varname> instance variable will be
   initialized with a proxy to the local ExchangeRate component
   whenever an instance of the ConvertedStockQuote is constructed.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <example>
    <title> Obtaining a proxy for a local PHP class </title>
    
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php 
   /**
     * The currency exchange rate service to use.
     *
     * @reference
     * @binding.php ../ExchangeRate/ExchangeRate.php
     */
    public $exchange_rate;
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </example>
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   For @binding.php, the URI identifies the location of the
   script containing the implementation of the component. The
   component will be called locally. The service provided is the set of
   public methods of the component. The URI must be a simple pathname,
   either absolute or relative. The component will be loaded with the
   PHP include directive, after testing to see if it is already loaded
   with
   <function>class_exists</function>. If the URI is a relative
   path, it is resolved relative to the component containing the
   annotation. Note that this is different from the normal PHP
   behaviour where scripts would be looked for along the PHP
   include_path, This is intended to provide some
   location-independence for cross-component references. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   If this ExchangeRate service were remote and to be called as a
   Web service, only the @binding line changes. Instead of giving the
   location of a PHP class, it gives the location of the WSDL describing
   the web service. In our example component, this is illustrated by
   the second reference: 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <example>
    <title> Obtaining a proxy for a web service </title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
/**
     * The stock quote service to use.
     *
     * @reference
     * @binding.soap ../StockQuote/StockQuote.wsdl
     */
    public $stock_quote;
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </example>
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   The StockQuote component will be called via a Web service
   request. In this case the URI for the WSDL can be a simple pathname, or
   may contain a PHP wrapper and begin, for example, with
   <varname>file://</varname> or
   <varname>http://</varname>. In the event that it is a simple
   pathname, it can be absolute or relative, and if relative will be
   resolved relative to the component containing the annotation.
   Note that this is like the behaviour for @binding.php, and
   different from the normal PHP behaviour where the file would be
   looked for relative to the PHP current working directory, which
   would usually be the location of the first script to be called. This
   behaviour is intended to give consistency across the different
   bindings and to provide some location-independence for
   references between components.

 <!-- {{{ Section Calling -->
 <section xml:id="sca.examples.calling">
  <title> Calling another Service Component </title>
  
  <para>
   The ConvertedStockQuote example also calls the proxies for
   the two components to which it refers. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <example>
    <title> Calling services </title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$quote  = $this->stock_quote->getQuote($ticker);
$rate   = $this->exchange_rate->getRate($currency);
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </example>
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   The call to the StockQuote service is a call to a local service;
   the call to the ExchangeRate service is a call to a remote service.
   Note that the way the call is made looks the same regardless of
   whether the call is to a local service or a remote one. 
  </para>

  <para> 
   The proxies which have been injected ensure that the way calls
   to components look and behave are the same way regardless of whether
   they are to a local or remote service, so that components are not
   sensitive to whether a call is to a local or a remote service. For
   example, the proxy for a local service takes copies of the arguments
   and passes only those copies, to ensure that calls are made to be
   pass-by-value, as they would be for a remote call. Also, the proxy
   for a remote service takes the arguments from a positional
   parameter list and ensures they are packaged properly in a SOAP
   request and converted back to a positional parameter list at the far
   end. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   In the example above, the
   
   <varname>$ticker</varname> and
   
   <varname>$currency</varname> are clearly PHP scalar types.
   Components can pass the PHP scalar types string, integer, float and
   boolean, but data structures on service calls are always passed as
   Service Data Objects (SDOs). A later section describes how a
   component can create an SDO to pass on a local or Web service call, or
   how a component can create an SDO to return. The PHP SDO project
   documentation describes how to work with the SDO APIs (see
   <link linkend="ref.sdo">the SDO pages</link>).

 <!-- {{{ Section nonscascript -->
 <section xml:id="sca.examples.nonscascript">
  <title>Locating and calling services from a script which is not an
   SCA Component </title>

  <para> 
   SCA components obtain proxies for other components or
   services as instance variables annotated with @reference, but
   this is not possible for a script that is not itself also a component.
   A client script which is not a component must use the
   <function>SCA::getService</function> static method to obtain a
   proxy for a service, whether local or remote. The
   <function>getService</function> method takes a URI as the
   argument. Typically this is the location of a local PHP script
   containing a component, or of a wsdl file, and is used in exactly the
   same way as the targets of the @binding annotations described in the
   previous section: that is, relative URIs are resolved against the
   location of the client script and not against the PHP include_path
   or current working directory. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   For example, a script that needed to obtain proxies for the
   ExchangeRate and StockQuote services but was not a component would
   use the
   <function>getService</function> method as follows:

 <section xml:id="sca.examples.exposing-webservice">
  <title> Exposing a Service Component as a Web service </title>
  
  <para> 
   SCA for PHP can generate WSDL from the annotations within a
   service component, so that it can be easily deployed and exposed as a
   Web service. To provide SCA with the information it needs to
   generate the WSDL, it is necessary to add the annotation
   @binding.soap under the @service annotation and to specify the
   parameters and return values of the methods using the @param and
   @return annotations. These annotations will be read when WSDL is
   generated, and the order and types of the parameters determine the
   contents of the
   &lt;schema&gt; section of the WSDL. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   SCA for PHP always generates document/literal wrapped WSDL
   for components that are exposing a Web service. Note that this does
   not stop components from consuming Web services which are not SCA
   components and which are documented with WSDL written in a
   different style. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   The scalar types which can be used in the @param annotation are
   the four common PHP scalar types: boolean, integer, float and
   string. These are simply mapped to the XML schema types of the same
   name in the WSDL. The example below, which is a trivial
   implementation of the StockQuote service that the
   ConvertedStockQuote component calls, illustrates string and
   float types.

   generate WSDL, the SCA runtime reflects on the component and
   examines the @param and @return annotations for each public
   method, as well as any @types annotations within the component. The
   information from the @param and @return annotations is used to
   build the &lt;types&gt; section of the WSDL. Any @types

   <para>
    The SCA run-time has special processing to handle how
    positional parameter lists in the interface are converted to XML
    containing named parameters in the soap request, and then back to
    positional parameter lists again. To see why this matters,
    consider how a PHP script which used a different interface to make a
    SOAP call would need to construct the parameter list. A PHP script
    using the PHP SoapClient, for example, would need to pass the
    SoapClient a single parameter giving the values for "ticker" and
    "currency", perhaps as an associative array. To insist that SCA
    components construct parameter lists to make Web service calls in
    this way would be to make local and remote calls look different, so a
    different approach is needed. 
   </para>
   
   <para>
    When SCA generates WSDL for an SCA component it includes a
    comment in the WSDL which marks that WSDL as being the interface for
    an SCA component. In this case, when one SCA component calls
    another through a Web service, the SCA runtime on the calling end
    takes the positional parameter list from the call and assigns the
    values one by one to the named elements in the soap message. For
    example a call to the
    <function>getQuote</function> method defined above that
    passes the values 'IBM' and 'USD' and looks like this: 
   </para>
   
   <para>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
  $quote = $remote_service->getQuote('IBM','USD');
?>
]]>
    </programlisting>
   </para>
   
   <para>
    will result in a soap message containing the
    following:
   </para>
   
   <para>
    <programlisting role="xml">
<![CDATA[
<getQuote>
  <ticker>IBM</ticker>
  <currency>USD</currency>
</getQuote>

    </programlisting>
   </para>
   
   <para>
    On the service-providing end, the SCA run-time takes the
    parameters one by one from the soap message and forms a positional
    parameter list from them, re-forming the argument list
    ('IBM','USD').
   </para>
   
   <caution>
    
    <para> 
     At both ends the SCA runtime relies on the order in which the
     parameters appear in the soap message being the same as that in the
     target method's parameter list. This is ultimately determined
     by the order of the @param annotations: this determines the order
     in which the parameters appear in the WSDL and thereby the order in
     which they appear in the soap message. Therefore it is essential
     that the order of the @param annotations matches that of the
     parameters in the method's parameter list.

  <title> Working with Data Structures </title>
  <para>
   SCA components can pass and return the four PHP scalar types
   boolean, integer, float and string, but to pass or return data
   structures, SCA components use Service Data Objects (SDOs). SDOs
   are described in much more detail in
   <link linkend="ref.sdo">the SDO pages</link> of this manual.
   Readers familiar with SDOs will know that they are suitable for
   representing the sort of structured and semi-structured data that
   is frequently modeled in XML, and that they serialize very
   naturally for passing between remote components, or in Web
   services. SDOs are presently the only supported way to pass and
   return data structures. It is not possible to pass or return PHP
   objects, or PHP arrays. 
  </para>
  
  <para> 
   The SCA runtime always assures data is passed by-value, even
   for local calls. To do this, the SCA runtime copies any SDOs in the
   parameter list before passing them on, just as it does for scalar
   types. 
  </para>
    
  <section xml:id="sca.examples.structures.defined"><!-- {{{ -->
   <title> How data structures are defined to SCA components </title>
   <para> 
    Currently the only mechanism for specifying the location of
    a data structure definition is by specifying the types in an XML
    schema file. However, in the future it may be possible to define
    types in other ways, such as based on PHP classes or interfaces, or
    based on definitions expressed as associative arrays. 
   </para>

    To illustrate the use of SDOs we introduce a new component.

      SCA_RuntimeException - signals a problem found by or

      whether a connection is being made to a local or a remote service:
      an error in one of the annotations within a component, a missing

   <title> Handling of Business exceptions </title>
   <para> 
    Business exceptions may be defined and thrown by a component
    in the normal way, regardless of whether the component has been
    called locally or remotely. The SCA runtime does not catch
    business exceptions that have been thrown by a component called
    locally, so they will be returned to a caller in the normal way. If a
    component has been called via a Web service, on the other hand, the
    SCA runtime on the service providing end does catch business
    exceptions, and will ensure these are passed back to the calling
    end and re-thrown. Assuming that the calling end has a definition
    of the exception (that is, is able to include a file containing the
    PHP class defining the exception) the re-thrown exception will
    contain the same details as the original, so that the
    <function>getLine</function> and
    <function>getFile</function> methods for example will contain
    the location where the exception was thrown within the business
    logic. The exception will be passed in the detail field of a soap
    fault with a fault code of "Client".
