    Most of the interface to SCA is through the annotations within
    SCA components so there are few public classes and methods. The only
    SCA classes that scripts or components can call are the <classname>SCA</classname>
    class itself, and the proxy classes <classname>SCA_LocalProxy</classname>
    and <classname>SCA_SoapProxy</classname>.
   </para>

    <para>
     Much of the work of the SCA class is performed when the file
     <filename>SCA.php</filename> is included within an SCA component.
     However, a PHP script may include
     <filename>SCA.php</filename> and call the
     <function>getService</function> method on the SCA class in order
     to obtain a proxy for a service. A component will not need to do this as
     proxies are obtained instead by defining an instance variable with
     the @reference annotation.
    </para>
    <para>
     Components that need to create an SDO to return to a caller will
     need a data factory to call. For this purpose the SCA class supports
     the
     <function>createDataObject</function> method, which will
     create an SDO according to the model defined by the component's
     @types annotations. The arguments to
     <function>createDataObject</function> are the same as those to
     SDO's XML Data Access Service.

    <para>
     When
     <function>getService</function> is called with the target of a
     local PHP component, a local proxy is returned. A local proxy is also
     injected into the instance variables of a component that are
     defined with an @reference and an @binding.php anotation. When the
     script or component makes calls on the local proxy, they are passed
     on to the target component itself.

     Components that need to create an SDO to pass to a component

     which will create an SDO according to the model defined by the
     components' @types annotations. The arguments to the

    <para>
     When
     <function>getService</function> is called with the target of a
     WSDL file, a SOAP proxy is returned. A SOAP proxy is also injected
     into the instance variables of a component that are defined with an
     @reference and an @binding.soap anotations. When the script or
     component makes calls on the SOAP proxy, they are formed into Web
     service SOAP requests and passed on to the target component, with
     the help of the PHP Soap extension.

     Components that need to create an SDO to pass to a component

     SDO according to the model defined within the target WSDL. The
     arguments to the <function>createDataObject</function> are the same
     as those to SDO's XML Data Access Service.
