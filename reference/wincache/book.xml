   Windows Cache Extension for PHP is a PHP accelerator that is used to increase the speed of 
   PHP applications running on Windows and Windows Server. Once the Windows Cache Extension for 
   PHP is enabled and loaded by the PHP engine, PHP applications can take advantage of the 
   functionality without any code modifications.
  </para>
  <para>
   The Windows Cache Extension includes 3 different types of caches. The following describes 
   the purpose of each cache type and the benefits it provides.

     <emphasis>PHP Opcode Cache</emphasis> - PHP is a script processing engine, which reads 
     an input stream of data that contains text and/or PHP instructions and produces another 
     stream of data, most commonly in the HTML format. This means that on a web server the 
     PHP engine reads, parses, compiles and executes a PHP script each time that it is requested 
     by a Web client. The reading, parsing and compilation operations put additional load on the 
     web server's CPU and file system and thus affect the overall performance of a PHP web application. 
     The PHP bytecode (opcode) cache is used to store the compiled script bytecode in shared memory so 
     that it can be re-used by PHP engine for subsequent executions of the same script.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>File Cache</emphasis> - Even with the PHP bytecode cache enabled, the PHP engine 
     has to accesses the script files on a file system. When PHP scripts are stored on a remote 
     UNC file share, the file operations introduce a significant performance overhead. 
     The Windows Cache Extension for PHP includes a file cache that is used to store the content 
     of the PHP script files in shared memory, which reduces the amount of file system operations 
     performed by PHP engine.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     <emphasis>Resolve File Path Cache</emphasis> - PHP scripts very often include or operate 
     with files by using relative file paths. Every file path has to be normalized to 
     an absolute file path by the PHP engine. When a PHP application uses many PHP files and 
     accesses them by relative paths, the operation of resolving the paths may negatively 
     impact the application's performance. The Windows Cache Extension for PHP 
     provides a Resolve File Path cache, which is used to store the mappings between relative 
     and absolute file paths, thereby reducing the number of path resolutions that the 
     PHP engine has to perform.
