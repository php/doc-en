   <para>
    Service Data Objects (SDOs) enable PHP applications to work with
    data from different sources (like a database query, an XML file, 
    and a spreadsheet) using a single interface.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each different kind of data source requires a Data Access Service 
    (DAS) to provide access to the data in the data source.
    In your PHP application, you use a DAS to create an SDO 
    instance that represents some data in the data source.  You can then 
    set and get values in the SDO instance using the standard SDO 
    interface.  Finally, you use a DAS to write the modified data back
    to a data source, typically the same one.
   </para>
   <para>
    See the
    <link linkend="sdo.das.table">list of Data Access Services</link>
    for details on those
    currently available.  In addition to the provided DASs, SDO also
    provides interfaces to enable others to be implemented 
    (see the section on <link linkend="sdo.class.sdo-das-spis">SDO Data
    Access Services Interface</link> for more details).
   </para>
    <para>
     This extension is derived from concepts taken from the
     <ulink url="&url.ibm.sdo;">Service Data Objects specification</ulink>.
     It includes a version of the
     <ulink url="&url.apache.tuscany;">Apache Tuscany</ulink> SDO for C++ project.
   </para>

   <section id="sdo.intro.structure">
    <title>The Structure of a Service Data Object</title>
    <para>
     A Service Data Object instance is made up of a tree of data objects.
     The tree is defined by containment relationships between the data 
     objects.  For example, a Company data object might consist of a number 
     of Department data objects and therefore the Company would have 
     a containment relationship to the Departments.  
    </para>
    <para> An SDO may also have non-containment references between data objects in the
     tree. For example, one Employee data object might reference another Employee to
     identify a career mentor. 
    </para>
    <para>
     As well as data objects referencing each other, they can also have
     primitive properties.  For example, the Company data object might
     have a property called "name" of type string, for holding the name
     of the company (for example, "Acme").
    </para>
    <para> Each of these properties of a data object - containment relationships,
     non-containment references, or primitive properties - may be many-valued or
     single-valued. In the above examples, Departments is many-valued and
    the Company name is single-valued.
    </para>
    <para> In PHP, each SDO data object is represented as a PHP object. The properties of the
     data object can be accessed using either object syntax or associative array syntax.
     We'll see some examples of this later.

  <section id="sdo.requirements">
   &reftitle.required;

    The SDO extension requires PHP 5.1.0 or higher. It also requires the
    libxml2 library. Normally libxml2 will already be installed, but if
    not, it can be downloaded from
    <ulink url='&url.libxml;'>

   <note>
    <para>
     Earlier versions of the SDO extension required a separate shared

     or
     <filename>sdo_das_xml.so</filename>

      If this were a containment relationship then the
      employee would be removed from the company 
      (probably not a good idea to sack your best employee each month!), 
      but since this is a non-containment reference, 
      the employee being referenced will remain in the 
      department in the company,
      but will no longer be accessible via the employeeOfTheMonth property.

     <title>Access via property index</title>
     <para> Data object properties can be accessed via their property index using array
      syntax. The property index is the position at which the property's definition
      appears in the model (in this case the xml schema). We can see from the schema listing
      above that the company name attribute is the second company property (the SDO
      interface makes no distinction between XML attributes and elements). The following
      sets the company name to 'Acme', with the same result as
      <link linkend="sdo.examples.propname">Access via property name</link>

     <para> Using the index directly in this way is likely to be fragile. Normally the
      property name syntax should be preferred, but the property index may be required
     in special cases.

   <title>Working with Sequenced Data Objects</title>

    Sequenced data objects are SDOs which can track property
    ordering across the properties of a data object. They can also
    contain unstructured text elements (text element which do not
    belong to any of the SDO's properties).  Sequenced data objects are
    useful for working with XML documents which allow unstructured text (i.e.
    mixed=true) or if the elements can be interleaved (
    <![CDATA[<A/><B/><A/>]]>).  This can occur for example when
    the schema defines maxOccurs>1 on a
    element which is a complexType with a choice order indicator.

    and instance information, using the XML Data Access Service.

    To ensure sequence indices are maintained, sequenced data objects
    should be manipulated through the SDO_Sequence interface.  
    This allows the data object's instance data to be manipulated 
    in terms of the sequence index as opposed to the property index 
    (shown in the table above).  
    The following examples assume the letter instance has been 
    loaded into a data object referenced by the variable
    <command>$letter</command>.

      Setting values through the data object interface may result in the

      object will only be accessible through the sequence if the property was
      already part of the sequence. The following example sets the
      lastName through the data object and gets it through the sequence.
      This is fine because lastName already exists in the sequence.  If
      it had not previously been set, then lastName would be set to
      'Smith', but would not be part of the sequence.

      A sequence behaves like a contiguous list; therefore, removing

      down. The following example tests to see if the first sequence

      It is worth noting that this is the SDO model and when these are

      The interface for constructing the model for an SDO_DataObject.
      The SDO_DAS_DataFactory is an abstract class providing a static

      The implementation is used by Data Access Services to create an 
      SDO model from their model.
      For example, a Relational Data Access Service might create and populate
      an SDO_DAS_DataFactory model based on a schema for a relational
      database.
