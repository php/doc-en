   <para>
    Service Data Objects (SDOs) enable PHP applications to work with
    data from different sources (like a database query, an XML file, 
    and a spreadsheet) using a single interface.
   </para>
   <para>
    Each different kind of data source requires a Data Access Service 
    (DAS) to provide access to the data in the data source.
    In your PHP application, you use a DAS to create an SDO 
    instance that represents some data in the data source.  You can then 
    set and get values in the SDO instance using the standard SDO 
    interface.  Finally, you use a DAS to write the modified data back
    to a data source (typically the same one).
   </para>
   <para>
    See the
    <link linkend="sdo.das.table">list of Data Access Services</link>
    for details on those
    currently available.  In addition to the provided DASs, SDO also
    provides interfaces to enable others to be implemented 
    (see the section on <link linkend="sdo.class.sdo-das-spis">SDO Data
    Access Services Interface</link> for more details).
   </para>
    <para>
    This extension is derived from concepts taken from the
    <ulink url='&url.ibm.sdo;'>
    Service Data Objects specification
    </ulink>
   </para>

   <section id="sdo.intro.structure">
    <title>The Structure of a Service Data Object</title>
    <para>
     A Service Data Object instance is made up of a tree of data objects.
     The tree is defined by containment references between the data objects.
     For example, a Company data object might consist of a number of 
     Department data objects and therefore the Company would have 
     a containment reference to the Departments.  
     Deleting a data object which has a containment reference to another
     data object will delete the referenced data object.  For example, 
     deleting the Company data object will also delete the Departments.
    </para>
    <para>
     An SDO may also have non-containment references between data objects 
     in the tree.  For example, one Employee data object might reference 
     another Employee to identify a career mentor.  Deleting a data object
     which has a non-containment reference to another data object does 
     not delete the referenced data object.
    </para>
    <para>
     As well as data objects referencing each other, they can also have
     primitive properties.  For example, the Company data object might
     have a property called "name" of type string, for holding the name
     of the company (for example, "Acme").

   There are several options, depending on whether you are installing on
   Windows or Linux, and depending on whether you are installing a released

    The instructions are likely to change as PHP 5.1 progresses in status

   <title>Working with Sequenced Data Objects</title>

    Sequenced data objects are SDOs which can track property
    ordering across the properties of a data object. They can also
    contain unstructured text elements (text element which do not
    belong to any of the SDO's properties).  Sequenced data objects are
    useful for working with XML documents which allow unstructured text (i.e.
    mixed=true) or if the elements can be interleaved (
    <![CDATA[<A/><B/><A/>]]>).  This can occur for example when
    the schema defines maxOccurs>1 on a
    element which is a complexType with a choice order indicator.

    To ensure sequence indices are maintained, sequenced data objects
    should be manipulated through the SDO_Sequence interface.  
    This allows the data object's instance data to be manipulated 
    in terms of the sequence index as opposed to the property index 
    (shown in the table above).  
    The following examples assume the letter instance has been 
    loaded into a data object referenced by the variable
    <command>$letter</command>.

      Setting values through the data object interface may result in the
      value not being part of the sequence.  A value set through the data
      object will only be accessible through the sequence if the property was
      already part of the sequence. The following example sets the
      lastName through the data object and gets it through the sequence.
      This is fine because lastName already exists in the sequence.  If
      it had not previously been set, then lastName would be set to
      'Smith', but would not be part of the sequence.

      We can use the <function>isset</function>  and

      A sequence behaves like a contiguous list; therefore, removing
      items from the middle will shift entries at higher indices
      down. The following example tests to see if the first sequence
      element is set and unsets it if is.

      <classname>SDO_DAS_ChangeSummary</classname>
     </title>
     <para>
      The interface through which the change history of a data
      object is accessed.  The change summary holds information for any
      modifications on a data object which occurred since logging
      was activated.  In the case of deletions and modifications, the old
      values are also held in the change summary.
     </para>
     <para>
      If logging is no longer active
      then the change summary only holds changes made up to the point when
      logging was deactivated.  
      Reactivating logging clears the change summary.
      This is useful when a set of changes have been written out by a
      DAS and the data object is to be reused.

     <para>
      The interface for constructing the model for an SDO_DataObject.
      The SDO_DAS_DataFactory is an abstract class providing a static
      method which returns a concrete data factory implementation.
      The implementation is used by Data Access Services to create an 
      SDO model from their model.
      For example, a Relational Data Access Service might create and populate
      an SDO_DAS_DataFactory model based on a schema for a relational
      database.
