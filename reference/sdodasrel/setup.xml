 <!-- {{{ Requirements -->
 <section xml:id="sdodasrel.requirements">
  &reftitle.required;
  <para>
   The Relational DAS requires that the SDO extension be installed.
   The SDO extension requires a version of PHP 5.1, and the 
   Relational DAS requires a recent version that contains 
   an important fix for PDO. The most up-to-date information about
   required levels of PHP should be found in the changelog for the 
   package on PECL. At the time of writing, though, the Relational 
   DAS requires the most recent beta level of PHP 5.1, that is 
   PHP 5.1.0.
  </para>
  <para>
   The Relational DAS uses PDO to access the relational database,
   and so should run with a variety of different relational databases.
   At the time of writing it has been tested in the following configurations
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      MySQL 4.1.14, on Windows. 
      The Relational DAS operates correctly with the php_pdo_mysql
      driver that comes with the pre-built binaries for PHP 5.1.0.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      MySQL 4.1.13, on Linux. It is necessary to have the most up-to-date
      PDO driver for MySQL, which comes built in to PHP 5.1.0. 
      It may be necessary to uninstall the usual driver that would have 
      come from PECL using 
      <command>pear uninstall pdo_mysql</command>
      . You will need to configure PHP with the 
      <command>--with-pdo-mysql</command> option.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      DB2 8.2 Personal Edition, on Windows.
      The Relational DAS operates correctly with the
      php_pdo_odbc driver that comes with the pre-built binaries for
      PHP 5.1.0.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      DB2 8.2 Personal Developer's Edition, on Linux. 
      The Developer's Edition is needed because it
      contains the include files needed when PHP is configured
      and built. You will need to configure PHP with the 
      <command>--with-pdo-odbc=ibm-db2</command> option.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   The Relational DAS applies changes to the database within
   a user-delimited transaction: that is, it issues a call to 
   <function>PDO::beginTransaction</function>
   before beginning to apply changes, and 
   <function>PDO::commit</function>
   or 
   <function>PDO::rollback</function>
   on completion.
   Whichever database is chosen, the database and the PDO driver
   for the database must support these calls. 
  </para>

 <!-- {{{ Installation -->
 <section xml:id="sdodasrel.installation">
  &reftitle.install;
  <para>
   The installation instructions for all the SDO components
   are in the SDO 
   <link linkend="sdo.installation">install</link>
   section of the SDO documentation.
  </para>
  <para>
   In any case, the essential facts are that 
   the Relational DAS is written in PHP and it 
   should be placed somewhere on the PHP
   <link linkend="ini.include-path">include_path</link>.
  </para>

  <para>
   Your application will of course need to include the Relational DAS 
   with a statement like this:
   <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
require_once 'SDO/DAS/Relational.php';
?>
]]>
   </programlisting>
  </para>
 </section>
 <!-- }}} -->

 <!-- {{{ Configuration -->
 <section xml:id="sdodasrel.configuration">
  &reftitle.runtime;
  &no.config;
  <section xml:id='sdo.das.rel.tracing'>
   <title>Tracing</title>
   <para>
    You may be interested in seeing the SQL statements that are generated 
    in order to apply changes back to the database. At the top of the
    <filename>SDO/DAS/Relational.php</filename>
    you will find a number of constants which control whether the process 
    of constructing and executing the SQL statements is to be traced.
    Try setting
    <varname>DEBUG_EXECUTE_PLAN</varname>
    to &true; to see the generated SQL statements.
