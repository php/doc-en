      Won't fix: #66616 R/W split fails: QOS with mysqlnd_get_last_gtid with built-in MySQL GTID
     </para>
     <para>
      This is not a bug in the plugins implementation but a server side feature
      limitation not considered and documented before. MySQL 5.6 built-in GTIDs cannot be
      used to ensure session consistency when reading from slaves in all cases.
      In the worst case the plugin will not consider using the slaves and
      fallback to using the master. There will be no wrong results but no benefit
      from doing GTID checks either.

        Fixed #66064 - Random once load balancer ignoring weights
      </para>
      <para>

        Fixed #65496 - Wrong check for slave delay
      </para>
      <para>
       The quality of service filter has erroneously ignored slaves
       that lag for zero (0) seconds if a any maximum lag had been set.
       Although a slave was not lagging behind, it was excluded from the
       load balancing list if a maximum age was set by the QoS filter.
       This was due to using the wrong comparison operator in the source
       of the filter.

    <para>
      Introduced an internal connection pool. When using Fabric and switching
      from shard group A to shard group B, we are replacing the entire list of
      masters and slaves. This troubles the connections state alignment logic and
      some filters. Some filters cache information on the master and slave lists.
      The new internal connection pool abstraction allows us to inform the filters
      of changes, hence they can update their caches.
     </para>
     <para>
      Later on, the pool can also be used to reduce connection overhead. Assume
      you are switching from a shard group to another and back again. Whenever
      the switch is done, the pool's active server (and connection) lists are
      replaced. However, no longer used connections are not necessarily closed
      immediately but can be kept in the pool for later reuse.
     </para>
     <para>
      Please note, the connection pool is internalat this point. There are some
      new statistics to monitor it. However, you cannot yet configure pool size
      of behaviour. 
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Added a basic distributed transaction abstraction.
      XA transactions can are supported ever since using standard SQL calls.
      This is inconvenient as XA participants must be managed manually.
      PECL/mysqlnd_ms introduces API calls to control XA transaction among MySQL servers.
      When using the new functions, PECL/mysqlnd_ms acts as a transaction coordinator.
      After starting a distributed transaction, the plugin tracks all servers
      involved until the transaction is ended and issues appropriate SQL statements
      on the XA participants.
     </para>
     <para>
       This is useful, for example, when using Fabric and sharding. When using
       Fabric the actual shard servers involved in a business transaction may not be known
       in advance. Thus, manually controlling a transaction that spawns multiple shards becomes
       difficult.
       Please, be warned about <link linkend="mysqlnd-ms.concept_xa_trx">current limitations</link>.

      to count the number of implicit retries. Some distributed
      database clusters use transient errors to hint a client to retry
      its operation in a bit. Most often, the client is then supposed
      to halt execution (sleep) for a short moment before retrying the
      desired operation. Immediately failing over to another node
      is not necessary in response to the error. Instead, a retry loop
      can be performed. Common situation when using MySQL Cluster.

      Setting transaction stickiness disables all load balancing, including
      automatic failover, for the duration of a transaction. So far
      connection switches could have happened in the middle of a transaction
      in multi-master configurations  and during automatic failover although
      transaction monitoring had detected transaction boundaries properly.

      BC break and bug fix. SQL hints enforcing the use of a specific

      <constant>MYSQLND_MS_SLAVE_SWITCH</constant>,
      <constant>MYSQLND_MS_LAST_USED_SWITCH</constant>) are ignored for the
      duration of a transaction of transaction stickiness is enabled and
      transaction boundaries have been detected properly.
     </para>
     <para>
      This is a change in behaviour. However, it is also a bug fix and a step
      to align behaviour. If, in previous versions, transaction stickiness,
      one of the above listed SQL hints and the quality of service filtering
      was combined it could happened that the SQL hints got ignored. In some
      case the SQL hints did work, in other cases they did not. The new
      behaviour is more consistent. SQL hints will always be ignore for
      the duration of a transaction, if
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.trx-stickiness">transaction stickiness</link>
      is enabled.
     </para>
     <para>
      Please note, transaction boundary detection continues to be based on API
      call monitoring. SQL commands controlling transactions are not monitored.

      BC break and bug fix. Calls to <function>mysqlnd_ms_set_qos</function>
      will fail when done in the middle of a transaction if
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.trx-stickiness">transaction stickiness</link>
      is enabled. Connection switches are not allowed for the duration of a
      transaction. Changing the quality of service likely results on a different
      set of servers qualifying for query execution, possibly making it
      necessary to switch connections. Thus, the call is not allowed in
      during an active transaction. The quality of server can, however, be
      changed in between transactions.

   Feature changes
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Introduced the <literal>node_group</literal> filter.
      The filter lets you organize servers (master and slaves)
      into groups. Queries can be directed to a certain group of servers
      by prefixing the query statement with a SQL hint/comment that contains
      the groups configured name. Grouping can be used for
      partitioning and sharding, and also to optimize for local caching.
      In the case of sharding, a group name can be thought of like a shard key.
      All queries for a given shard key will be executed on the
      configured shard. Note: both the client and server must support sharding
      for sharding to function with mysqlnd_ms.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
    <para>
      Extended configuration file validation during PHP startup (RINIT).
      An <constant>E_WARNING</constant> level error will be thrown if the configuration
      file can not be read (permissions), is empty, or the file (JSON) could not be parsed.
      Warnings may appear in log files, which depending on how PHP is configured.
    </para>
    <para>
      Distributions that aim to provide a pre-configured setup, including a
      configuration file stub, are asked to put <literal>{}</literal> into
      the configuration file to prevent this warning about an invalid
      configuration file.
     </para>
    <para>
      Further configuration file validation is done when parsing sections
      upon opening a connection. Please, note that there may still be situations
      when an invalid plugin configuration file does not lead to proper error messages
      but a failure to connect.
    </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      As of PHP 5.5.0, improved support for transaction boundaries detection was added for
      <literal>mysqli</literal>. The <literal>mysqli</literal> extension has been
      modified to use the new C API calls of the <literal>mysqlnd</literal>
      library to begin, commit, and rollback a transaction or savepoint.
      If <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.trx-stickiness">trx_stickiness</link>
      is used to enable transaction aware load balancing, the <function>mysqli_begin</function>,
      <function>mysqli_commit</function> and <function>mysqli_rollback</function> functions
      will now be monitered by the plugin, to go along with the <function>mysqli_autocommit</function>
      function that was already supported. All SQL features to control
      transactions are also available through the improved <literal>mysqli</literal>
      transaction control related functions. This means that it is not required to
      issue SQL statements instead of using API calls. Applications
      using the appropriate API calls can be load balanced by PECL/mysqlnd_ms
      in a completely transaction-aware way.
     </para>
     <para>
      Please note, <literal>PDO_MySQL</literal> has not been updated
      yet to utilize the new mysqlnd API calls. Thus, transaction boundary
      detection with <literal>PDO_MySQL</literal> continues to be limited to
      the monitoring by passing in <constant>PDO::ATTR_AUTOCOMMIT</constant> to
      <methodname>PDO::setAttribute</methodname>.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Introduced <literal>trx_stickiness=on</literal>. This
      <link linkend="ini.mysqlnd-ms-plugin-config-v2.trx-stickiness">trx_stickiness</link>
      option differs from <literal>trx_stickiness=master</literal> as it
      tries to execute a read-only transaction on a slave, if
      quality of service (consistency level) allows the use of a slave.
      Read-only transactions were introduced in MySQL 5.6, and they
      offer performance gains.

       Query cache support is considered beta if used with the <literal>mysqli</literal>

      Introduced <literal>wait_for_gtid_timeout</literal> setting to throttle
      slave reads that need session consistency. If global transaction identifier are

      tries to find up-to-date slaves. The slave status check is done by
      a SQL statement. If nothing else is set, the slave status is checked only
      one can the search for more up-to-date slaves continues immediately
      thereafter. Setting <literal>wait_for_gtid_timeout</literal> instructs the plugin
      to poll a slaves status for <literal>wait_for_gtid_timeout</literal> seconds
      if the first execution of the SQL statement has shown that the slave is not
      up-to-date yet. The poll will be done once per second. This way, the plugin
      will wait for slaves to catch up and throttle the client.

      New failover strategy <literal>loop_before_master</literal>.
      By default the plugin does no failover. It is possible to enable

      only <literal>master</literal> strategy existed to failover to a master if
      a slave connection fails. <literal>loop_before_master</literal> is

   The 1.3 series aims to improve the performance of applications
   and the overall load of an asynchronous MySQL cluster, for example, a MySQL
   cluster using MySQL Replication. This is done by transparently replacing
   a slave access with a local cache access, if the application allows it by
   setting an appropriate quality of service flag. When using MySQL replication
   a slave can serve stale data. An application using MySQL replication must
   continue to work correctly with stale data. Given that the application
   is know to work correctly with stale data, the slave access can transparently
   be replace with a local cache access.

  <para>
   In version 1.2 the focus continues to be on supporting MySQL database clusters
   with asynchronous replication. The plugin tries to make using the cluster
   introducing a quality-of-service filter which applications can use to define
   what service quality they need from the cluster. Service levels provided are
   eventual consistency with optional maximum age/slave slag, session consistency
   and strong consistency.
  </para>
  <para>
   Additionally the plugin can do client-side global transaction id injection
   to make manual master failover easier.

  <para>
    The <function>mysqlnd_ms_set_user_pick_server</function> function was removed, and
    replaced in favor of a new <literal>user</literal> filter. You can no longer set a
    callback function using <function>mysqlnd_ms_set_user_pick_server</function> at
    runtime, but instead have to configure it in the plugins configuration file. The <literal>user</literal>
    filter will pass the same arguments to the callback as before.
    Therefore, you can continue to use the same procedural function as a callback.callback
    It is no longer possible to use static class methods, or class methods of
    an object instance, as a callback. Doing so will cause the function
    executing a statement handled by the plugin to emit an
    <constant>E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR</constant> level error, which might look like:
    "<literal>(mysqlnd_ms) Specified callback (picker) is not a valid callback</literal>."
    Note: this may halt your application.
