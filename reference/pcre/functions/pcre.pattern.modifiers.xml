     The current possible PCRE modifiers are listed below.  The names
     in parentheses refer to internal PCRE names for these modifiers.

    <term><emphasis>i</emphasis> (PCRE_CASELESS)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, letters in the pattern match both
      upper and lower case letters.
     </simpara>

       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>m</emphasis> (PCRE_MULTILINE)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a
      single "line" of characters (even if it actually contains
      several newlines). The "start of line" metacharacter (^)
      matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of
      line" metacharacter ($) matches only at the end of the
      string, or before a terminating newline (unless
      <emphasis>D</emphasis> modifier is set). This is the same as
      Perl.
     </simpara>
     <simpara>
      When this modifier is set, the "start of line" and "end of
      line" constructs match immediately following or immediately
      before any newline in the subject string, respectively, as
      well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent to
      Perl's /m modifier. If there are no "\n" characters in a
      subject string, or no occurrences of ^ or $ in a pattern,
      setting this modifier has no effect.
     </simpara>

   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>s</emphasis> (PCRE_DOTALL)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, a dot metacharacter in the pattern
      matches all characters, including newlines. Without it,
      newlines are excluded. This modifier is equivalent to Perl's
      /s modifier.  A negative class such as [^a] always matches a
      newline character, independent of the setting of this
      modifier.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
   </varlistentry>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>x</emphasis> (PCRE_EXTENDED)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, whitespace data characters in the
      pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a
      character class, and characters between an unescaped #
      outside a character class and the next newline character,
      inclusive, are also ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's /x
      modifier, and makes it possible to include comments inside
      complicated patterns. Note, however, that this applies only
      to data characters. Whitespace characters may never appear
      within special character sequences in a pattern, for example
      within the sequence (?( which introduces a conditional
      subpattern.
     </simpara>

    <term><emphasis>e</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, <function>preg_replace</function>
      does normal substitution of backreferences in the
      replacement string, evaluates it as PHP code, and uses the
      result for replacing the search string.
     </simpara>
     <para>
      Only <function>preg_replace</function> uses this modifier;
      it is ignored by other PCRE functions.
      <note>
       <simpara>
        This modifier was not available in PHP 3.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>A</emphasis> (PCRE_ANCHORED)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, the pattern is forced to be
      "anchored", that is, it is constrained to match only at the
      start of the string which is being searched (the "subject
      string").  This effect can also be achieved by appropriate
      constructs in the pattern itself, which is the only way to
      do it in Perl.
     </simpara>

       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>D</emphasis> (PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      If this modifier is set, a dollar metacharacter in the pattern
      matches only at the end of the subject string. Without this
      modifier, a dollar also matches immediately before the final
      character if it is a newline (but not before any other
      newlines).  This modifier is ignored if <emphasis>m</emphasis>
      modifier is set. There is no equivalent to this modifier in
      Perl.
     </simpara>

       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>S</emphasis></term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      When a pattern is going to be used several times, it is
      worth spending more time analyzing it in order to speed up
      the time taken for matching. If this modifier is set, then
      this extra analysis is performed. At present, studying a
      pattern is useful only for non-anchored patterns that do not
      have a single fixed starting character.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>U</emphasis> (PCRE_UNGREEDY)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      This modifier inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so
      that they are not greedy by default, but become greedy if
      followed by "?". It is not compatible with Perl. It can also
      be set by a (?U) modifier setting within the pattern.
     </simpara>
    </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>X</emphasis> (PCRE_EXTRA)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      This modifier turns on additional functionality of PCRE that
      is incompatible with Perl. Any backslash in a pattern that
      is followed by a letter that has no special meaning causes
      an error, thus reserving these combinations for future
      expansion. By default, as in Perl, a backslash followed by a
      letter with no special meaning is treated as a literal.
      There are at present no other features controlled by this
      modifier.
     </simpara>

       <varlistentry>
    <term><emphasis>u</emphasis> (PCRE_UTF8)</term>
    <listitem>
     <simpara>
      This modifier turns on additional functionality of PCRE that
      is incompatible with Perl. Pattern strings are treated as
      UTF-8. This modifier is available from PHP 4.1.0 or greater
      on Unix and from PHP 4.2.3 on win32.
