  <para>The source code can be downloaded here : http://pecl.php.net/package/solr </para>
  <para>In order to build or compile the extension from source, the following libraries are needed :</para>
  <para>libxml2 2.6.31 or later is required.</para>
  <para>libcurl 7.18.0 or later is also required.</para>

  <para>To install the Apache Solr extension directly from PECL, please follow the following steps:</para>
  <example>

<![CDATA[ pecl install solr-beta ]]>
   </screen>
  </example>
  
  <para>To compile from source on UNIX, you will need to follow the steps below :</para>
  <example>
   <title>Installation of Apache Solr on UNIX</title>
   <screen>
<![CDATA[1. tar -zxvf solr_xxx.tgz (or unzip solr_xxx.zip)
 
2. cd solr_xxx
 
3. phpize 
 
4A. ./configure --enable-solr

The solr module can be compiled in debug mode by passing the --enable-solr-debug flag to configure

If your system does not have the current version of the libcurl or libxml libraries, you can download the libraries

and compile them from source into a separate install prefix.

wget http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.19.6.tar.gz

tar -zxvf curl-7.19.6.tar.gz

cd curl-7.19.6

configure --prefix=/root/custom/software

make && make install

cd ..

wget ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.7.6.tar.gz

tar -zxvf libxml2-2.7.6.tar.gz

cd libxml2-2.7.6

configure --prefix=/root/custom/software

make && make install

This example assumes that the libxml2 and libcurl libraries were compiled from source

and installed using "/root/custom/software" as the --prefix

So the absolute path to the easy.h header file will be 

/root/custom/software/include/curl/easy.h

And the absolute path to the libxml/parser.h header file wil be 

/root/custom/software/include/libxml2/libxml/parser.h

The absolute path to the xml2-config script will be /root/custom/software/bin/xml2-config

And the absolute path to the curl-config script will be /root/custom/software/bin/curl-config

Then you can pass libcurl prefix to the configure script for CURL and LIBXML respectively 

during the configuration phase as shown here :

4B ./configure --enable-solr --with-curl=/root/custom/software --with-libxml-dir=/root/custom/software

If you already have the latest versions of the libraries then the step listed in 4A alone is sufficient.

5. make && make install
 
This should compile the code and install it in the extension_dir specified in the ini file.

Then open your php.ini file and add the following line to it

extension=solr.so

If you would prefer to compile the Solr extension statically into php,

you will need to follow the following steps.

1. copy the solr_xxx folder into the ext folder in the php source

2. Include the --enable-solr flag as one of the options when configuring php

This will build the Solr extension statically into php.

After the installation is completed, you will have to restart your webserver for the changes to take effect. 

For CLI only use, you do not have to restart your webserver.

<![CDATA[If you are using a pre-compiled dll, simply copy the php_solr.dll file 

to your extension_dir specified in the php.ini file.

Then open your php.ini file and add the following line to it

extension=php_solr.dll

Then restart your webserver. For CLI only, you do not have to restart your webserver.

If you are building from source, you will need to download the library dependencies
for libxml and libcurl from the following link to the deps folder before 
running buildconf.bat

The Apache Solr extension can be compiled statically or shared.

- Shared compilation creates a php_solr.dll file.
- Static compilation puts the Solr extension directly into PHP (therefore it does not need to be loaded and cannot be unloaded).

You can toggle between compiling statically or as library by adding =static or =shared to the configure.js command during the compilation.

configure --with-solr=static

configure --with-solr=shared

- In the first configure command, the Apache Solr extension will be included in PHP
- In the second configure command, the Apache Solr extension will be compiled as separate DLL

Here is a more detail list of steps to follow :

1. Get visual studio 2008 ((express edition or professional) and install it.
2. Get and install windows sdk 6.1.
3. Get a php 5.3 snapshot (do not extract yet!).
4. Create the folder "c:\php-sdk"
5. Unpack the binary tools archive into this directory, there should be one sub-directory called "bin" and one called "script"
6. Open the "windows sdk 6.1 shell" (which is available from the start menu group) and execute the following commands in it:

setenv /x86 /xp /release
cd c:\php-sdk\
bin\phpsdk_setvars.bat
bin\phpsdk_buildtree.bat php53dev

7. Now extract the snapshot from Step 3 to C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86 with your favourite unpacker so that the following directory gets created: 

C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3-xyz

8. run in the windows-sdk-shell:
cd C:\php-sdk\php53dev\vc9\x86\php5.3-xyz
buildconf

9. now run configure --help, to get an overview of the compiling flags

10. configure --disable-all --enable-cli --with-solr=yes --with-curl=yes --with-libxml=yes

11. nmake

If you are using Visual Studio 2005, use vc8 wherever you see vc9.

If you are on a 64-bit system, use x64 instead of x86.
