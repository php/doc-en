   xdiff extension enables you to create and apply patch files containing
   differences between different revisions of files.
  </para>
  <para>
   This extension supports two modes of operation - on strings and on files, as well
   as two different patch formats - unified and binary. Unified patches are excellent
   for text files as they are human-readable and easy to review. For binary files like
   archives or images, binary patches will be adequate choice as they are binary safe and
   handle non-printable characters well.
  </para>
  <para>
   Starting from version 1.5.0 there are two different sets of functions for generating
   binary patches. New functions - <function>xdiff_string_rabdiff</function> and 
   <function>xdiff_file_rabdiff</function> generate output compatible with older functions
   but are typically faster and generate smaller results. For more details about methods of
   generating binary patches and differences between them, please check 
   <link xlink:href="&url.xdiff;">libxdiff</link> website.
  </para>
  <para>
   This extension uses libxdiff to implement these functions. Please see
