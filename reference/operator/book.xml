   This extension allows you to define and implement operator overloading for objects.
   It is possible to define how an object reacts when an operator is used on it.

  <para>
   One example of this is creating a collection type object that has the addition
   operator overloaded to allow adding elements to the collection or adding two
   collections together.
  </para>
  <para>
   Another example is creating an enhanced string class that has the multiplication
   operator overloaded to allow repeating the string a certain number of times.
