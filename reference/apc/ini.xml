  Although the default APC settings are fine for many installations, serious
  users should consider tuning the following parameters.
 </para>
 <para>
  There are two main decisions you have to make.  First, how much shared
  memory do you want to set aside for APC, and second, whether you want APC
  to check if a file has been modified on every request.  The two ini
  directives involved here are <literal>apc.shm_size</literal> and 
  <literal>apc.stat</literal>.  Read the sections on these two directives
  carefully below.
 </para>
 <para>
  Once you have a running server, you should copy the
  <literal>apc.php</literal> script that comes with the extension to
  somewhere in your docroot and load it up in your browser.  It provides
  you with a detailed look at what is happening in your cache.  If you
  have GD enabled in PHP, it will even have pretty graphs.  First thing
  to check is of course that it is actually caching files.  Assuming it is
  working you should then pay close attention to the <literal>Cache full
  count</literal> number on the left.  That tells you the number of times
  the cache has filled up and has had to forcefully clean up any entries
  not accessed within the last <literal>apc.ttl</literal> seconds.  You
  should configure your cache to minimize this number.  If you are constantly
  filling your cache, the resulting cache churn is going to hurt performance.
  You should either set more memory aside for APC, or use
  <literal>apc.filters</literal> to cache fewer scripts.

      On very busy servers whenever you start the server or
      modify files you can create a race of many processes
      all trying to cache the same file at the same time.
      This option sets the percentage of processes that will
      skip trying to cache an uncached file.  Or think of it
      as the probability of a single process to skip caching.
      For example, setting <literal>apc.slam_defense</literal>
      to <literal>75</literal> would mean that there is
      a 75% chance that the process will not cache an uncached
      file. So, the higher the setting the greater the defense
      against cache slams.  Setting this to <literal>0</literal>
      disables this feature.

      When you modify a file on a live web server you really
      should do so in an atomic manner.  That is, write to a
      temporary file and rename (<literal>mv</literal>) the file into its
      permanent position when it is ready.  Many text editors, cp, tar and
      other such programs don't do this.  This means that there
      is a chance that a file is accessed (and cached) while it
      is still being written to.  This <literal>apc.file_update_protection</literal>
      setting puts a delay on caching brand new files.  The
      default is 2 seconds which means that if the modification
      timestamp (<literal>mtime</literal>) on a file shows that it is less than 2
      seconds old when it is accessed, it will not be cached.
      The unfortunate person who accessed this half-written file
      will still see weirdness, but at least it won't persist.
      If you are certain you always atomically update your files
      by using something like rsync which does this correctly, you
      can turn this protection off by setting it to 0.  If you
      have a system that is flooded with io causing some update
      procedure to take longer than 2 seconds, you may want to
      increase this a bit.

      Be careful if you change this setting.  The default is for this to be On
      which means that APC will stat (check) the script on each request to see
      if it has been modified.  If it has been modified it will recompile and
      cache the new version.  If you turn this setting off, it will not check.
      That means that in order to have changes become active you need to
      restart your web server.  On a production server where you rarely
      change the code, turning stats off can produce a significant performance
      boost.
     </para>
     <para>
      For included/required files this option applies as well, but note that
      if you are using relative path includes (any path that doesn't start
      with / on Unix) APC has to check in order to uniquely identify the file.
      If you use absolute path includes APC can skip the stat and use that
      absolute path as the unique identifier for the file.

      On busy servers when you first start up the server, or when many files

      and cache the same files. With write_lock enabled, only one process at a
      time will try to compile an uncached script while the other processes
      will run uncached instead of sitting around waiting on a lock.

      RFC1867 File Upload Progress hook handler is only available if you

      The frequency that updates should be made to the user cache entry for
      upload progress.  This can take the form of a percentage of the total
      file size or a size in bytes optionally suffixed with 'k', 'm', or 'g'
      for kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes respectively (case insensitive).
      A setting of 0 updates as often as possible, which may cause slower
      uploads.
