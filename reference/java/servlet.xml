 <title>Java Servlet SAPI</title>
 <para>
  The Java Servlet SAPI builds upon the mechanism defined by the Java
  extension to enable the entire PHP processor to be run as a servlet.
  The primary advantage of this from a PHP perspective is that web servers
  which support servlets typically take great care in pooling and reusing
  JVMs. Build instructions for the Servlet SAPI module can be found in 
  <filename>php4/sapi/README</filename>.

     While this code is intended to be able to run on any servlet engine,
     it has only been tested on Apache's Jakarta/tomcat to date. Bug
     reports, success stories and/or patches required to get this code
     to run on other engines would be appreciated.

     PHP has a habit of changing the working directory. sapi/servlet will
     eventually change it back, but while PHP is running the servlet engine
     may not be able to load any classes from the CLASSPATH which are
     specified using a relative directory syntax, or find the work directory
     used for administration and JSP compilation tasks.
