  <title>Using remote files</title>

  <para>
   As long as support for the "URL fopen wrapper" is enabled when
   you configure PHP (which it is unless you explicitly pass the
   <option>--disable-url-fopen-wrapper</option> flag to configure),
   you can use HTTP and FTP URLs with most functions that take a
   filename as a parameter, including the <function>require</function>
   and <function>include</function> statements.

  <note>
   <para>
    You can't use remote files in <function>include</function> and
    <function>require</function> statements on Windows.
  </note>

  <para>
   For example, you can use this to open a file on a remote web server,
   parse the output for the data you want, and then use that data in a
   database query, or simply to output it in a style matching the rest
   of your website.

  <para>
   <example>
    <title>Getting the title of a remote page</title>
    <programlisting>
&lt?php
  $file = fopen("http://www.php.net/", "r");
  if (!$file) {
    echo "&lt;p>Unable to open remote file.\n";
    exit;
  }
  while (!feof($file)) {
    $line = fgets($file, 1024);
    /* This only works if the title and its tags are on one line. */
    if (eregi("&lt;title>(.*)&lt;/title>", $line, $out)) {
      $title = $out[1];
      break;
    }
  }
  fclose($file);
?&gt;
    </programlisting>
   </example>

  <para>
   You can also write to files on an FTP as long you connect as a user
   with the correct access rights, and the file doesn't exist already.
   To connect as a user other than 'anonymous', you need to specify
   the username (and possibly password) within the URL, such as
   'ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com/path/to/file'. (You can use the
   same sort of syntax to access files via HTTP when they require Basic
   authentication.)

  <para>
   <example>
    <title>Storing data on a remote server</title>
    <programlisting>
&lt?php
  $file = fopen("ftp://ftp.php.net/incoming/outputfile", "w");
  if (!$file) {
    echo "&lt;p>Unable to open remote file for writing.\n";
    exit;
  }
  /* Write the data here. */
  fputs($file, "$HTTP_USER_AGENT\n");
  fclose($file);
?&gt;
    </programlisting>
   </example>

  <note>
   <para>
    You might get the idea from the example above to use this technique to
    write to a remote log, but as mentioned above, you can only write to
    a new file using the URL fopen() wrappers. To do distributed logging
    like that, you should take a look at <function>syslog</function>.
