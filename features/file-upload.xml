   <simpara>
    This feature lets people upload both text and binary files. 
    With PHP's authentication and file manipulation functions,
    you have full control over who is allowed to upload and
    what is to be done with the file once it has been uploaded.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
    compliant browser.

    PHP also supports PUT-method file uploads as used by
    <productname>Netscape Composer</productname> and W3C's 
    <productname>Amaya</productname> clients.  See the <link

    <example>
     <title>File Upload Form</title>
     <para>
      A file upload screen can be built by creating a special form which
      looks something like this:
     </para>
     <programlisting role="html">
<![CDATA[
<!-- The data encoding type, enctype, MUST be specified as below -->
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="__URL__" method="POST">
    <!-- MAX_FILE_SIZE must precede the file input field -->
    <input type="hidden" name="MAX_FILE_SIZE" value="30000" />
    <!-- Name of input element determines name in $_FILES array -->
    Send this file: <input name="userfile" type="file" />
    <input type="submit" value="Send File" />
</form>
]]>
     </programlisting>
     <para>
      The <literal>__URL__</literal> in the above example should be replaced,
      and point to a PHP file.
     </para>
     <para>
      The <literal>MAX_FILE_SIZE</literal> hidden field (measured in bytes) must
      precede the file input field, and its value is the maximum filesize accepted by PHP.
      This form element should always be used as it saves users the trouble of
      waiting for a big file being transferred only to find that it was too
      large and the transfer failed.  Keep in mind: fooling this setting on the
      browser side is quite easy, so never rely on files with a greater size
      being blocked by this feature. It is merely a convenience feature for
      users on the client side of the application. The PHP settings (on the server
      side) for maximum-size, however, cannot be fooled.
     </para>
    </example>
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Be sure your file upload form has attribute <literal>enctype="multipart/form-data"</literal>
     otherwise the file upload will not work.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    The global <varname>$_FILES</varname> will contain all the uploaded file information.
    Its contents from the example form is as follows. Note that this assumes the use of 
    the file upload name <emphasis>userfile</emphasis>, as used in the example 
    script above. This can be any name.
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$_FILES['userfile']['name']</varname></term>

     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$_FILES['userfile']['type']</varname></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this
        information.  An example would be
        <literal>"image/gif"</literal>. This mime type is however
        not checked on the PHP side and therefore don't take its value
        for granted.

      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

   <para>
    Files will, by default be stored in the server's default temporary
    directory, unless another location has been given with the <link
    linkend="ini.upload-tmp-dir">upload_tmp_dir</link> directive in
    &php.ini;. The server's default directory can
    be changed by setting the environment variable
    <envar>TMPDIR</envar> in the environment in which PHP runs.
    Setting it using <function>putenv</function> from within a PHP
    script will not work. This environment variable can also be used
    to make sure that other operations are working on uploaded files,
    as well.

   <simpara>
    The PHP script which receives the uploaded file should implement
    whatever logic is necessary for determining what should be done
    with the uploaded file. You can, for example, use the
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['size']</varname> variable
    to throw away any files that are either too small or too big.  You
    could use the
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['type']</varname> variable
    to throw away any files that didn't match a certain type criteria, but
    use this only as first of a series of checks, because this value
    is completely under the control of the client and not checked on the PHP
    side.
    Also, you could use <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['error']</varname> 
    and plan your logic according to the <link
    linkend="features.file-upload.errors">error codes</link>.
    Whatever the logic, you should either delete the file from the
    temporary directory or move it elsewhere.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    If no file is selected for upload in your form, PHP will return
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['size']</varname> as 0, and
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']</varname> as none.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The file will be deleted from the temporary directory at the end
    of the request if it has not been moved away or renamed.

    PHP returns an appropriate error code along with the 
    file array.  The error code can be found in the 
    <literal>error</literal> segment of the file array that is created 
    during the file upload by PHP. In other words, the error might be 
    found in <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['error']</varname>.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The value of this error code is one of the
    <constant>UPLOAD_ERR_<replaceable>*</replaceable></constant>
    constants.

  <sect1 xml:id="features.file-upload.common-pitfalls">
   <title>Common Pitfalls</title>
   <simpara>
    The <literal>MAX_FILE_SIZE</literal> item cannot specify a file size 
    greater than the file size that has been set in the <link
    linkend="ini.upload-max-filesize">upload_max_filesize</link> in
    the &php.ini; file. The default is 2 megabytes.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    If a memory limit is enabled, a larger <link
    linkend="ini.memory-limit">memory_limit</link> may be needed. Make
    sure you set <link linkend="ini.memory-limit">memory_limit</link>
    large enough.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    If <link linkend="ini.max-execution-time">max_execution_time</link>
    is set too small, script execution may be exceeded by the value. Make
    sure you set <literal>max_execution_time</literal> large enough.
   </simpara>
   <note>
    <simpara>
     <link linkend="ini.max-execution-time">max_execution_time</link> only
     affects the execution time of the script itself.  Any time spent
     on activity that happens outside the execution of the script
     such as system calls using <function>system</function>, the
     <function>sleep</function> function, database queries, time taken by
     the file upload process, etc. is not included when determining the maximum
     time that the script has been running.
    </simpara>
   </note>
   <warning>
    <simpara>
     <link linkend="ini.max-input-time">max_input_time</link> sets the maximum
     time, in seconds, the script is allowed to receive input; this includes
     file uploads.  For large or multiple files, or users on slower connections,
     the default of <literal>60</literal> seconds may be exceeded.
    </simpara>
   </warning>
   <simpara>
    If <link linkend="ini.post-max-size">post_max_size</link> is set too
    small, large files cannot be uploaded.  Make sure you set
    <literal>post_max_size</literal> large enough.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The
    <link linkend="ini.max-file-uploads">max_file_uploads</link> configuration
    setting controls the maximum number of files that can uploaded in one
    request. If more files are uploaded than the limit, then
    <varname>$_FILES</varname> will stop processing files once the limit is
    reached. For example, if
    <link linkend="ini.max-file-uploads">max_file_uploads</link> is set to
    <literal>10</literal>, then <varname>$_FILES</varname> will never contain
    more than 10 items.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Not validating which file you operate on may mean that users can access
    sensitive information in other directories.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Due to the large amount of directory listing styles we cannot guarantee
    that files with exotic names (like containing spaces) are handled properly.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    A developer may not mix normal <literal>input</literal> fields and file upload fields in the same
    form variable (by using an <literal>input</literal> name like <literal>foo[]</literal>).
   </simpara>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 xml:id="features.file-upload.multiple">
   <title>Uploading multiple files</title>
   <simpara>
    Multiple files can be uploaded using different
    <literal>name</literal> for <literal>input</literal>.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    It is also possible to upload multiple files simultaneously and
    have the information organized automatically in arrays for you. To
    do so, you need to use the same array submission syntax in the
    HTML form as you do with multiple selects and checkboxes:
   </simpara>
   <para>
    <example>
     <title>Uploading multiple files</title>
     <programlisting role="html">
<![CDATA[
<form action="file-upload.php" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  Send these files:<br />
  <input name="userfile[]" type="file" /><br />
  <input name="userfile[]" type="file" /><br />
  <input type="submit" value="Send files" />
</form>
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </example>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    When the above form is submitted, the arrays
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']</varname>,
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['name']</varname>, and
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['size']</varname> will be
    initialized.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    For instance, assume that the filenames
    <filename>/home/test/review.html</filename> and
    <filename>/home/test/xwp.out</filename> are submitted.  In this
    case, <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['name'][0]</varname>
    would contain the value <filename>review.html</filename>, and
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['name'][1]</varname> would
    contain the value <filename>xwp.out</filename>. Similarly,
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['size'][0]</varname> would
    contain <filename>review.html</filename>'s file size, and so forth.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['name'][0]</varname>,
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name'][0]</varname>,
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['size'][0]</varname>, and
    <varname>$_FILES['userfile']['type'][0]</varname> are
    also set.
   </simpara>
   <warning>
    <simpara>
     The
     <link linkend="ini.max-file-uploads">max_file_uploads</link>
     configuration setting acts as a limit on the number of files that can be
     uploaded in one request. You will need to ensure that your form does not
     try to upload more files in one request than this limit.

     <title>Uploading an entire directory</title>
     <simpara>
      In HTML file upload fields, it is possible to upload an entire directory with the <literal>webkitdirectory</literal> attribute.
      This feature is supported in most modern browsers.
     </simpara>
     <simpara>
      With the <literal>full_path</literal> information, it is possible to store the relative paths,
      or reconstruct the same directory in the server.

    </example>

    <warning>
     <simpara>
      The <literal>webkitdirectory</literal> attribute is non-standard and is not on a standards track.
      Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user.
      There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.
     </simpara>
     <simpara>
      PHP only parses the relative path information submitted by the browser/user-agent,
      and passes that information to the <varname>$_FILES</varname> array.
      There is no guarantee that the values in the <literal>full_path</literal> array contains a real directory structure,
      and the PHP application must not trust this information.

  <sect1 xml:id="features.file-upload.put-method">
   <title>PUT method support</title>
   <para>
    PHP provides support for the HTTP PUT method used by some clients to store
    files on a server.
    PUT requests are much simpler than a file upload using POST requests
    and they look something like this:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting role="HTTP">
<![CDATA[
PUT /path/filename.html HTTP/1.1
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    This would normally mean that the remote client would like to save
    the content that follows as: <filename>/path/filename.html</filename> in your web tree.
    It is obviously not a good idea for Apache or PHP to automatically
    let everybody overwrite any files in your web tree.  So, to handle
    such a request you have to first tell your web server that you
    want a certain PHP script to handle the request.  In Apache you do
    this with the <emphasis>Script</emphasis> directive.  It can be
    placed almost anywhere in your Apache configuration file.  A
    common place is inside a <literal>&lt;Directory&gt;</literal> block or perhaps inside
    a <literal>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</literal> block.  A line like this would do the trick:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
Script PUT /put.php
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    This tells Apache to send all PUT requests for URIs that match the
    context in which you put this line to the <filename>put.php</filename> script. This
    assumes, of course, that you have PHP enabled for the <filename class="extension">.php</filename>
    extension and PHP is active. The destination resource for all PUT 
    requests to this script has to be the script itself, not a filename the
    uploaded file should have.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    With PHP you would then do something like the following in
    your put.php. This would copy the contents of the uploaded file to the
    file <filename>myputfile.ext</filename> on the server.
    You would probably want to perform some checks and/or
    authenticate the user before performing this file copy.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    <example>
     <title>Saving HTTP PUT files</title>
     <programlisting role="php">
