   <title>POST method uploads</title>

   <simpara>
    PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
    compliant browser (which includes Netscape Navigator 3 or later,
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 with a patch from Microsoft, or
    later without a patch).  This feature lets people upload both text
    and binary files.  With PHP's authentication and file manipulation
    functions, you have full control over who is allowed to upload and
    what is to be done with the file once it has been uploaded.
   </simpara>
   <para>
    Note that PHP also supports PUT-method file uploads as used by
    Netscape Composer and W3C's Amaya clients.  See the <link
    linkend="features.file-upload.put-method">PUT Method
    Support</link> for more details.
   </para>
   <para>
    A file upload screen can be built by creating a special form which
    looks something like this:
    <example>
     <title>File Upload Form</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;FORM ENCTYPE=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; ACTION=&quot;_URL_&quot; METHOD=POST&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;MAX_FILE_SIZE&quot; value=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;
Send this file: &lt;INPUT NAME=&quot;userfile&quot; TYPE=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Send File&quot;&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
     </programlisting>
    </example>
    The _URL_ should point to a PHP file.  The MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden
    field must precede the file input field and its value is the
    maximum filesize accepted.  The value is in bytes.
   </para>

   <para>
    In PHP 3, the following variables will be defined within the
    destination script upon a successful upload, assuming that <link
    linkend="ini.register-globals">register_globals</link> is turned
    on in <filename>php.ini</filename>. If <link
    linkend="ini.track-vars">track_vars</link> is turned on, they will
    also be available within the global array
    <varname>$HTTP_POST_VARS</varname>. Note that the following
    variable names assume the use of the file upload name 'userfile',
    as used in the example above:

    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <varname>$userfile</varname> - The temporary filename in which
       the uploaded file was stored on the server machine.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <varname>$userfile_name</varname> - The original name or path
       of the file on the sender's system.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <varname>$userfile_size</varname> - The size of the uploaded
       file in bytes.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <varname>$userfile_type</varname> - The mime type of the file
       if the browser provided this information.  An example would be
       &quot;image/gif&quot;.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Note that the &quot;$userfile&quot; part of the above variables is
    whatever the name of the INPUT field of TYPE=file is in the upload
    form.  In the above upload form example, we chose to call it
    &quot;userfile&quot;
   </para>

   <para>
    In PHP 4, the behaviour is slightly different, in that the new
    global array <varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES</varname> is provided to
    contain the uploaded file information. This is still only
    available if <link linkend="ini.track-vars">track_vars</link> is
    turned on, but <link linkend="ini.track-vars">track_vars</link> is
    always turned on in versions of PHP after PHP 4.0.2.
   </para>

   <para>
    The contents of <varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES</varname> are as
    follows. Note that this assumes the use of the file upload name
    'userfile', as used in the example above:
    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['name']</varname></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The original name of the file on the client machine.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['type']</varname></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The mime type of the file, if the browser provided this
        information.  An example would be
        <literal>&quot;image/gif&quot;</literal>.
        </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['size']</varname></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The size, in bytes, of the uploaded file.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term><varname>$HTTP_POST_FILES['userfile']['tmp_name']</varname></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The temporary filename of the file in which the uploaded file
        was stored on the server.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>

   <para>
    Files will by default be stored in the server's default temporary
    directory, unless another location has been given with the <link
    linkend="ini.upload-tmp-dir">upload_tmp_dir</link> directive in
    <filename>php.ini</filename>. The server's default directory can
    be changed by setting the environment variable
    <envar>TMPDIR</envar> in the environment in which PHP runs.
    Setting it using <function>putenv</function> from within a PHP
    script will not work. This environment variable can also be used
    to make sure that other operations are working on uploaded files,
    as well.

      The following examples are for versions of PHP 3 greater than
      3.0.16, and versions of PHP 4 greater than 4.0.2. See the
      function entries for <function>is_uploaded_file</function> and
      <function>move_uploaded_file</function>.

move_uploaded_file($userfile, "/place/to/put/uploaded/file");

     <para>
      For earlier versions of PHP, you'll need to do something like
      the following.
      <note>
       <para>
        This will <emphasis>not</emphasis> work in versions of PHP 4
        after 4.0.2. It depends on internal functionality of PHP which
        changed after that version.

   <simpara>
    The PHP script which receives the uploaded file should implement
    whatever logic is necessary for determining what should be done
    with the uploaded file.  You can for example use the
    <varname>$file_size</varname> variable to throw away any files
    that are either too small or too big.  You could use the
    <varname>$file_type</varname> variable to throw away any files
    that didn't match a certain type criteria.  Whatever the logic,
    you should either delete the file from the temporary directory or
    move it elsewhere.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The file will be deleted from the temporary directory at the end
    of the request if it has not been moved away or renamed.

  <sect1 id="features.file-upload.common-pitfalls">
   <title>Common Pitfalls</title>
   <simpara>
    The MAX_FILE_SIZE item cannot specify a file size greater than the file 
    size that has been set in the upload_max_filesize in the PHP 3.ini file
    or the corresponding php3_upload_max_filesize Apache .conf directive. 
    The default is 2 Megabytes.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Not validating which file you operate on may mean that users can access
    sensitive information in other directories.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Please note that the CERN httpd seems to strip off everything
    starting at the first whitespace in the content-type mime header
    it gets from the client.  As long as this is the case, CERN httpd
    will not support the file upload feature.

  <sect1 id="feature-fileupload.multiple">
   <title>Uploading multiple files</title>
   <simpara>
    It is possible to upload multiple files simultaneously and have
    the information organized automatically in arrays for you. To
    do so, you need to use the same array submission syntax in the
    HTML form as you do with multiple selects and checkboxes:
   </simpara>
   <note>
    <para>
     Support for multiple file uploads was added in version 3.0.10.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    <example>
     <title>Uploading multiple files</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;form action=&quot;file-upload.html&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;
  Send these files:&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;userfile[]&quot; type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;userfile[]&quot; type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send files&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
     </programlisting>
    </example>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    When the above form is submitted, the arrays
    <computeroutput>$userfile</computeroutput>,
    <computeroutput>$userfile_name</computeroutput>, and
    <computeroutput>$userfile_size</computeroutput> will be formed in
    the global scope (as well as in $HTTP_POST_FILES ($HTTP_POST_VARS
    in PHP 3)). Each of these will be a numerically indexed array of
    the appropriate values for the submitted files.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    For instance, assume that the filenames
    <filename>/home/test/review.html</filename> and
    <filename>/home/test/xwp.out</filename> are submitted.  In this
    case, <computeroutput>$userfile_name[0]</computeroutput> would
    contain the value <computeroutput>review.html</computeroutput>,
    and <computeroutput>$userfile_name[1]</computeroutput> would
    contain the value
    <computeroutput>xwp.out</computeroutput>. Similarly,
    <computeroutput>$userfile_size[0]</computeroutput> would contain
    <filename>review.html</filename>'s filesize, and so forth.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    <computeroutput>$userfile['name'][0]</computeroutput>,
    <computeroutput>$userfile['tmp_name'][0]</computeroutput>,
    <computeroutput>$userfile['size'][0]</computeroutput>, and
    <computeroutput>$userfile['type'][0]</computeroutput> are also set.

  <sect1 id="features.file-upload.put-method">
   <title>PUT method support</title>

   <para>
    PHP provides support for the HTTP PUT method used by clients such
    as Netscape Composer and W3C Amaya.  PUT requests are much simpler
    than a file upload and they look something like this:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
PUT /path/filename.html HTTP/1.1
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <para>
    This would normally mean that the remote client would like to save
    the content that follows as: /path/filename.html in your web tree.
    It is obviously not a good idea for Apache or PHP to automatically
    let everybody overwrite any files in your web tree.  So, to handle
    such a request you have to first tell your web server that you
    want a certain PHP script to handle the request.  In Apache you do
    this with the <emphasis>Script</emphasis> directive.  It can be
    placed almost anywhere in your Apache configuration file.  A
    common place is inside a &lt;Directory&gt; block or perhaps inside
    a &lt;Virtualhost&gt; block.  A line like this would do the trick:
    <informalexample>
     <programlisting>
Script PUT /put.php3
     </programlisting>
    </informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    This tells Apache to send all PUT requests for URIs that match the
    context in which you put this line to the put.php3 script.  This
    assumes, of course, that you have PHP enabled for the .php3
    extension and PHP is active.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Inside your put.php3 file you would then do something like this:
   </simpara>
   <para>
    <informalexample><programlisting>
&lt;? copy($PHP_UPLOADED_FILE_NAME,$DOCUMENT_ROOT.$REQUEST_URI); ?&gt;
    </programlisting></informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    This would copy the file to the location requested by the remote
    client.  You would probably want to perform some checks and/or
    authenticate the user before performing this file copy.  The only
    trick here is that when PHP sees a PUT-method request it stores
    the uploaded file in a temporary file just like those handled but
    the <link
    linkend="features.file-upload.post-method">POST-method</link>.
    When the request ends, this temporary file is deleted.  So, your
    PUT handling PHP script has to copy that file somewhere.  The
    filename of this temporary file is in the $PHP_PUT_FILENAME
    variable, and you can see the suggested destination filename in
    the $REQUEST_URI (may vary on non-Apache web servers).  This
    destination filename is the one that the remote client specified.
    You do not have to listen to this client.  You could, for example,
    copy all uploaded files to a special uploads directory.
