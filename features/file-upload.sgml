   <title>POST method uploads</title>

   <simpara>
    PHP is capable of receiving file uploads from any RFC-1867
    compliant browser (which includes Netscape Navigator 3 or later,
    Microsoft Internet Explorer 3 with a patch from Microsoft, or
    later without a patch).  This feature lets people upload both text
    and binary files.  With PHP's authentication and file manipulation
    functions, you have full control over who is allowed to upload and
    what is to be done with the file once it has been uploaded.
   </simpara>

   <para>
    Note that PHP also supports PUT-method file uploads as used by 
    Netscape Composer and W3C's Amaya clients.  See the <link
    linkend="features.file-upload.put-method">PUT Method Support</link>
    for more details.

   <para>
    A file upload screen can be built by creating a special form which
    looks something like this:

    <example>
     <title>File Upload Form</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;FORM ENCTYPE=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; ACTION=&quot;_URL_&quot; METHOD=POST&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;MAX_FILE_SIZE&quot; value=&quot;1000&quot;&gt;
Send this file: &lt;INPUT NAME=&quot;userfile&quot; TYPE=&quot;file&quot;&gt;
&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Send File&quot;&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
    </programlisting>
    </example>
    
    The _URL_ should point to a PHP file.  The MAX_FILE_SIZE hidden
    field must precede the file input field and its value is the maximum
    filesize accepted.  The value is in bytes.  In this destination file,
    the following variables will be defined upon a successful upload:

   <para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       $userfile - The temporary filename in which the uploaded file
       was stored on the server machine.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       $userfile_name - The original name of the file on the sender's
       system.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       $userfile_size - The size of the uploaded file in bytes.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       $userfile_type - The mime type of the file if the browser
       provided this information.  An example would be
       &quot;image/gif&quot;.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    
    Note that the &quot;$userfile&quot; part of the above variables is
    whatever the name of the INPUT field of TYPE=file is in the upload
    form.  In the above upload form example, we chose to call it
    &quot;userfile&quot;.

   <simpara>
    Files will by default be stored in the server's default temporary
    directory.  This can be changed by setting the environment variable
    <envar>TMPDIR</envar> in the environment in which PHP runs.  Setting
    it using <function>putenv</function> from within a PHP script will
    not work.

   <simpara>
    The PHP script which receives the uploaded file should implement
    whatever logic is necessary for determining what should be done
    with the uploaded file.  You can for example use the $file_size
    variable to throw away any files that are either too small or too
    big.  You could use the $file_type variable to throw away any
    files that didn't match a certain type criteria.  Whatever the
    logic, you should either delete the file from the temporary
    directory or move it elsewhere.

   <simpara>
    The file will be deleted from the temporary directory at the end
    of the request if it has not been moved away or renamed.
 
  <sect1 id="features.file-upload.common-pitfalls">
   <title>Common Pitfalls</title>
   <simpara>
    The MAX_FILE_SIZE item cannot specify a file size greater than the file 
    size that has been set in the upload_max_filesize in the PHP3.ini file
    or the corresponding php3_upload_max_filesize Apache .conf directive. 
    The default is 2 Megabytes.
   <simpara>
    Please note that the CERN httpd seems to strip off everything
    starting at the first whitespace in the content-type mime header
    it gets from the client.  As long as this is the case, CERN httpd
    will not support the file upload feature.

  <sect1 id="feature-fileupload.multiple">
   <title>Uploading multiple files</title>
   <simpara>
    It is possible to upload multiple files simultaneously and have
    the information organized automatically in arrays for you. To
    do so, you need to use the same array submission syntax in the
    HTML form as you do with multiple selects and checkboxes:
   <note>
    <para>
     Support for multiple file uploads was added in version 3.0.10.
    </note>

   <para>
    <example>
     <title>Uploading multiple forms</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;form action=&quot;file-upload.html&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;
  Send these files:&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;userfile[]&quot; type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input name=&quot;userfile[]&quot; type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Send files&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
     </programlisting>
    </example>

   <simpara>
    When the above form is submitted, the arrays <computeroutput>$userfile</computeroutput>,
    <computeroutput>$userfile_name</computeroutput>, and
    <computeroutput>$userfile_size</computeroutput> will be formed in the global
    scope (as well as in $HTTP_POST_VARS). Each of these will be a
    numerically indexed array of the appropriate values for the
    submitted files. 
 
   <simpara>
    For instance, assume that the filenames
    <filename>/home/test/review.html</filename> and
    <filename>/home/test/xwp.out</filename> are submitted.  In this
    case, <computeroutput>$userfile_name[0]</computeroutput> would contain
    the value <computeroutput>review.html</computeroutput>, and
    <computeroutput>$userfile_name[1]</computeroutput> would contain the
    value <computeroutput>xwp.out</computeroutput>. Similarly,
    <computeroutput>$userfile_size[0]</computeroutput> would contain
    <filename>review.html</filename>'s filesize, and so forth.

  <sect1 id="features.file-upload.put-method">
   <title>PUT method support</title>

   <para>
    PHP provides support for the HTTP PUT method used by clients such
    as Netscape Composer and W3C Amaya.  PUT requests are much simpler
    than a file upload and they look something like this:

    <informalexample><programlisting>
PUT /path/filename.html HTTP/1.1
    </programlisting></informalexample>
   </para>

   <para>
    This would normally mean that the remote client would like to save
    the content that follows as: /path/filename.html in your web tree.
    It is obviously not a good idea for Apache or PHP to automatically
    let everybody overwrite any files in your web tree.  So, to handle
    such a request you have to first tell your web server that you
    want a certain PHP script to handle the request.  In Apache you do
    this with the <emphasis>Script</emphasis> directive.  It can be
    placed almost anywhere in your Apache configuration file.  A
    common place is inside a &lt;Directory&gt; block or perhaps inside
    a &lt;Virtualhost&gt; block.  A line like this would do the trick:

    <informalexample><programlisting>
Script PUT /put.php3
    </programlisting></informalexample>
   </para>

   <simpara>
    This tells Apache to send all PUT requests for URIs that match the
    context in which you put this line to the put.php3 script.  This
    assumes, of course, that you have PHP enabled for the .php3
    extension and PHP is active.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Inside your put.php3 file you would then do something like this:
   </simpara>
   <para>
    <informalexample><programlisting>
&lt;? copy($PHP_UPLOADED_FILE_NAME,$DOCUMENT_ROOT.$REQUEST_URI); ?&gt;
    </programlisting></informalexample>
   </para>
   <simpara>
    This would copy the file to the location requested by the remote
    client.  You would probably want to perform some checks and/or
    authenticate the user before performing this file copy.  The only
    trick here is that when PHP sees a PUT-method request it stores
    the uploaded file in a temporary file just like those handled bu the
    <link linkend="features.file-upload.post-method">POST-method</link>.
    When the request ends, this temporary file is deleted.  So, your PUT
    handling PHP script has to copy that file somewhere.  The filename
    of this temporary file is in the $PHP_PUT_FILENAME variable, and
    you can see the suggested destination filename in the $REQUEST_URI
    (may vary on non-Apache web servers).  This destination filename is
    the one that the remote client specified.  You do not have to listen
    to this client.  You could, for example, copy all uploaded files to
    a special uploads directory.
