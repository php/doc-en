  <title>Persistent Database Connections</title>

  <title>What are Persistent Connections?</title>
  <simpara>
   Persistent connections are links that do not close when the
   execution of your script ends. When a persistent connection is
   requested, PHP checks if there's already an identical persistent
   connection (that remained open from earlier) - and if it exists, it
   uses it. If it does not exist, it creates the link. An 'identical'
   connection is a connection that was opened to the same host, with
   the same username and the same password (where applicable).
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   People who aren't thoroughly familiar with the way web servers work
   and distribute the load may mistake persistent connects for what
   they're not. In particular, they do <emphasis>not</emphasis> give
   you an ability to open 'user sessions' on the same link, they
   do <emphasis>not</emphasis> give you an ability to build up a
   transaction efficiently, and they don't do a whole lot of other
   things. In fact, to be extremely clear about the subject,
   persistent connections don't give you <emphasis>any</emphasis>
   functionality that wasn't possible with their non-persistent
   brothers.

  <title>Web Requests</title>
  <simpara>
   There are two ways in which your web server can utilize PHP to generate
   web pages:
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The first method is to use PHP as a CGI "wrapper". When run this
   way, an instance of the PHP interpreter is created and destroyed
   for every page request (for a PHP page) to your web server.
   Because it is destroyed after every request, any resources that it
   acquires (such as a link to an SQL database server) are closed when
   it is destroyed. In this case, you do not gain anything from trying
   to use persistent connections -- they simply don't persist.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   The second, and most popular, method is to run PHP-FPM, or PHP as a module
   in a multiprocess web server, which currently only includes Apache.
   These setups typically have one process (the parent) which
   coordinates a set of processes (its children) who actually do the
   work of serving up web pages. When a request comes in from a
   client, it is handed off to one of the children that is not already
   serving another client. This means that when the same client makes
   a second request to the server, it may be served by a different
   child process than the first time. When opening a persistent connection,
   every following page requesting SQL services can reuse the same
   established connection to the SQL server.
  </simpara>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="persistent-connections.cli">
  <title>Command-line Processes</title>
  <simpara>
   As command-line PHP uses a new process for each script, persistent
   connections are not shared between command-line scripts, so there is no
   value in using them in transient scripts such as crons or commands.
   However, they may be useful if, for example, you're writing a long-running
   application server that serves many requests (or other connections) and each
   may need their own database connection.
  </simpara>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="persistent-connections.why">
  <title>Why Use Them?</title>
  <simpara>
   Persistent connections are good if the overhead to create a link to your
   SQL server is high. Whether or not this overhead is really high depends
   on many factors. Like, what kind of database it is, whether or not
   it sits on the same computer on which your web server sits, how
   loaded the machine the SQL server sits on is and so forth. The
   bottom line is that if that connection overhead is high, persistent
   connections help you considerably. They cause the child process to
   simply connect only once for its entire lifespan, instead of every
   time it processes a page that requires connecting to the SQL
   server. This means that for every child that opened a persistent
   connection will have its own open persistent connection to the
   server. For example, if you had 20 different child processes that
   ran a script that made a persistent connection to your SQL server,
   you'd have 20 different connections to the SQL server, one from
   each child.
  </simpara>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="persistent-connections.drawbacks.conn-limits">
  <title>Potential Drawbacks: Connection Limits</title>
  <simpara>
   Note, however, that this can have some drawbacks if you are using a
   database with connection limits that are exceeded by persistent
   child connections. If your database has a limit of 16 simultaneous
   connections, and in the course of a busy server session, 17 child
   threads attempt to connect, one will not be able to. If there are
   bugs in your scripts which do not allow the connections to shut
   down (such as infinite loops), the database with only 16 connections
   may be rapidly swamped. Check your database documentation for
   information on handling abandoned or idle connections (timeouts).
  </simpara>
 </simplesect>

 <simplesect xml:id="persistent-connections.drawbacks.state">
  <title>Potential Drawbacks: Maintaining Connection State</title>
  <simpara>
   Depending on your application and the database or extension you're using you
   may need to ensure that the state of connections is cleaned up before the
   script exits. Changes that may leave connections in an unexpected state
   include:
  </simpara>
  <simplelist>
   <member>Selected / default database</member>
   <member>Table locks</member>
   <member>Uncommitted transactions</member>
   <member>Temporary tables</member>
   <member>Connection specific settings or features such as profiling</member>
  </simplelist>
  <simpara>
   Table locks and transactions that are not cleaned up or closed may cause
   other queries to be blocked indefinitely and/or cause subsequent reuse of
   the connection to cause unexpected changes.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   Having the wrong database selected will cause subsequent reuse of the
   connection to be unable to execute queries as expected (or execute them on
   the wrong database if schemas are similar enough).
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   If temporary tables are not cleaned up, subsequent requests will not be able
   to recreate the same table.
  </simpara>
  <simpara>
   You can implement cleanup using class destructors or
   <function>register_shutdown_function</function>. You may also want to
   consider dedicated connection pooling proxies that include this as part of
   their functionality.
