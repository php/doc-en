  <title>Using remote files</title>

  <para>
   As long as support for the &quot;URL fopen wrapper&quot; is enabled when
   you configure PHP (which it is unless you explicitly pass the
   <option>--disable-url-fopen-wrapper</option> flag to configure (for versions 
   up to 4.0.3) or set <parameter>allow_url_fopen</parameter> to off in php.ini 
   (for newer versions),
   you can use HTTP and FTP URLs with most functions that take a
   filename as a parameter, including the <function>require</function>
   and <function>include</function> statements.
  </para>

     You can't use remote files in <function>include</function> and
     <function>require</function> statements on Windows.

   For example, you can use this to open a file on a remote web server,
   parse the output for the data you want, and then use that data in a
   database query, or simply to output it in a style matching the rest
   of your website.

   <example>
    <title>Getting the title of a remote page</title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$file = fopen ("http://www.php.net/", "r");
if (!$file) {
    echo "<p>Unable to open remote file.\n";
    exit;
}
while (!feof ($file)) {
    $line = fgets ($file, 1024);
    /* This only works if the title and its tags are on one line */
    if (eregi ("<title>(.*)</title>", $line, $out)) {
        $title = $out[1];
        break;
    }
}
fclose($file);
?>

   You can also write to files on an FTP as long you connect as a user
   with the correct access rights, and the file doesn't exist already.
   To connect as a user other than 'anonymous', you need to specify
   the username (and possibly password) within the URL, such as
   'ftp://user:password@ftp.example.com/path/to/file'. (You can use the
   same sort of syntax to access files via HTTP when they require Basic
   authentication.)
  </para>

   <example>
    <title>Storing data on a remote server</title>
    <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$file = fopen ("ftp://ftp.php.net/incoming/outputfile", "w");
if (!$file) {
    echo "<p>Unable to open remote file for writing.\n";
    exit;
}
/* Write the data here. */
fputs ($file, "$HTTP_USER_AGENT\n");
fclose ($file);
?>

     You might get the idea from the example above to use this
     technique to write to a remote log, but as mentioned above, you
     can only write to a new file using the URL fopen() wrappers. To
     do distributed logging like that, you should take a look at
     <function>syslog</function>.
