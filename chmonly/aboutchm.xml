  <title>About This Edition</title>

  <para>
   The Windows HTML Help Edition of the PHP Manual is aimed at
   developers, who want the manual at hand every time, and would like
   to read manual pages and user notes without waiting for a remote
   web page to download. This edition gives you the full content of the
   manual plus the user notes, with some great features provided by
   the viewer application by the scripts we use to generate this
   format and by other contributors in the form of skins.
  </para>

  <para>
   This distribution of the PHP Manual contains many files, including the
   main manual file <filename>php_manual_en.chm</filename>. You can view
   the manual by double clicking on this file (as you already guessed).
   <!--
   The user notes are in <filename>php_manual_notes.chm</filename>. You
   only need to have one copy of this file on your computer, regardless
   of how many languages you use to read the PHP Manual. The only
   requirement is that you need to have all <filename>php_manual_LANG.chm</filename>
   files in one directory with <filename>php_manual_notes.chm</filename>.
   -->
   You may also see a <filename>php_manual_en.chw</filename> file in the
   directory, it's generated the first time you use the index tab, and
   it contains an index with the manual's pages.
