  <title>Skin development</title>

  <para>
   This edition of the PHP Manual allows users to choose from skins to
   display the contents, as well as develop custom skins to meet some
   special needs. We decided to support skins because we realized that
   one skin cannot satisfy everybody's needs in a such heavily used
   edition.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   We included two skins by default inside the CHM. These cannot be modified
   or removed, so if you have the CHM, you have these two skins inside. The
   Low skin is optimized for small window display, the High skin is a
   variation of the Low one with some graphics added to spice it up.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   A skin must have at least two files, a skin loader JavaScript file and
   a CSS file. The two inline skins have these files inside the CHM. The
   skin loader JS should at least load in the CSS file and display the
   page contents to the viewer. Theoretically there are two kinds of skins:
   CSS skins and Full skins. CSS skins only modify the CSS and does not
   amend the page layout. Full skins also modify the page layout. We have
   included sample skins for both the CSS skin type and the Full skin type
   (<literal>"greenlinks"</literal> and <literal>"headernostalgia"</literal>
   respectively).
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <warning>
    <para>
     Note that though the current skin development methods are quite final,
     there may be heavy changes in used CSS classes or page elements while
     we refine the skin development ideas. As this edition is currently in
     development stage, the information described herein is not to be
     considered completely stable.

   <title>Page Display Process</title>

   <para>
    If you are going to develop your own skin, you should know how one
    page is loaded and displayed to the user, and how a skin fits in
    this process. For these paragraphs, we assume that you have put
    your CHM into <filename>c:\phpmanual</filename>, so it's accessible
    as <filename>c:\phpmanual\php_manual_LANG.chm</filename> (where LANG
    is the language code), and you would like to see the function page
    of "echo", which is <filename>function.echo.html</filename> inside
    the CHM. See the <link linkend="chm.integration">sections about
    integration</link> for more information on CHM contents.
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       First of all the HTML content is loaded in from
       <filename>function.echo.html</filename> from inside the CHM.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       At the top of this file, there is a HTML <literal>&lt;script&gt;</literal>
       tag, which loads in the <filename>_script.js</filename> file from the
       CHM. This file contains all the JS code needed to move on with the process.
       Most importantly this JS defines many variables (like where the CHM
       is, or what is the actual page viewed) and many functions to print
       out the context menu or handle online functions.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       At last <filename>_script.js</filename> loads in the preferences
       file from outside the CHM (<filename>c:\phpmanual\php_manual_prefs.js</filename>
       in our example). This JS file defines the preference variables, and
       calls back <literal>prefHandler()</literal> which is also defined in
       <filename>_script.js</filename>.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       That function loads in the skin JS file as the preferences
       dictate. The skin JS file should load in the needed CSS
       file, and define a <literal>displayPage()</literal> function,
       which displays the page if called.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       The HTML file (<filename>function.echo.html</filename> in this
       example) also contains a function call to load in the user notes,
       which simply puts the notes into this HTML file using DHTML to
       be displayed as if they were here before...
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       The HTML file also contains a body onload attribute which
       calls the skin-defined <literal>displayPage()</literal> function
       to show the page to the user. This is the last function called,
       it should present the page in it's complete form to the user.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    Every action is synchronized with calling back a function in
    the previously loaded file when the JS is in memory. The notes
    loading and skin JS loading is only synchronized with the page's
    onload event (which as the Microsoft documentation says only fires
    if the page is completely loaded).
   </para>
   <para>
    This load and callback chain may seem to be too complicated, but
    so far this seemed to be the best way to do as many things as
    possible parallel, while also synchronize some calls.
   </para>
   <para>
    As you can see your skin JavaScript file is loaded in by
    <filename>_script.js</filename> and it's <literal>displayPage()</literal>
    function is called by the body onload event.
   </para>

  <sect1 xml:id="chm.skins.elements">
   <title>Page Elements</title>

   <para>
    The PHP Manual pages are all HTML files with several HTML tags in them
    for both presentational and divisional purposes. The HTML pages contain
    divisions to be used for skinning purposes and misc divisions added by
    the DocBook XSL sheets.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    A HTML page can be either a function reference page or another kind
    of page (like a feature description). Skins should get ready to skin
    these two kinds of pages separately most of the time (depending on
    the actual design).
   </para>
   
   <para>
    The pages are structured using <literal>&lt;div&gt;</literal> tags
    with appropriate IDs to ease the skin writers work. A page consists
    of these parts:
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <literal>&lt;div id="pageContent"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</literal> contains
       all the page contents. This begins right after
       <literal>&lt;body&gt;</literal> and ends just before
       <literal>&lt;/body&gt;</literal>. This division is hidden by default,
       you need to show it after you are ready with the page rewriting
       process.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <literal>&lt;div id="pageHeaders"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</literal> contains
       the page header parts. This includes the text only main title
       (in a <literal>&lt;span id="pageTitle"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>)
       and function properties, in case this is a function page (contained
       in <literal>&lt;span id="funcPurpose"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>,
       <literal>&lt;span id="funcAvail"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal> and
       <literal>&lt;span id="funcUsage"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>).
       In case one of these three is not available, the current page is not
       a function page.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <literal>&lt;div id="pageText"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</literal> contains the
       majority of the page contents, including examples, manual notes,
       warnings, etc. This also includes see also parts for now, as we
       still cannot differentiate between see also and normal text parts
       (may be a thing to change in the future).
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <literal>&lt;div id="pageNotes"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</literal> contains the
       user notes (itself loaded in from another HTML file by JS). It contains
       a heading, and then a <literal>&lt;div&gt;</literal> without ID for
       every user note and spans in that divs for every element of a user
       note (with "email", "date" and "text" IDs respectively).
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <simpara>
       <literal>&lt;div id="pageNav"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</literal> contains the
       navigation table, which is further divided into spans (<literal>&lt;span
       id="navPrev"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;span
       id="navPath"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;span
       id="navNext"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;span
       id="navOnline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>, <literal>&lt;span
       id="navThisOnline"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal> and <literal>&lt;span
       id="navReportBug"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</literal>), where navThisOnline
       and navReportBug is inside navOnline.
      </simpara>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    If you would like to rewrite the page, you should first read in the
    parts you need from the page to JS variables, then clear the contents
    of pageContent (or just the part you would like to rewrite), write in
    the new content and show the pageContent div for the user. If you would
    not like to make any structural changes, you can simply display the
    pageContent div and only specify a special style sheet in your skin JS
    file (see the <literal>"greenlinks"</literal> skin for an example).
   </para>
   <para>
    You can find a "Full skin" developed to show you how to make skins built
    on top of this structure. The skin name is <literal>"headernostalgia"</literal>.
    It rewrites the header part and removes the footer navigational table.

   <title>CSS classes</title>
   <para>
    We cannot provide accurate documentation currently on usable CSS
    classes, as some of the DocBook XSL sheets classes are not used and
    some classes are added. Please see the sample CSS files included for
    first time reference.
