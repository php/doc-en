  <title>Specialities of this Edition</title>

  <para>
   The HTML Help Edition of the PHP Manual over-performs the
   presentational and interactive capabilities offered by other editions
   (including the online manual).
  </para>
  
  <sect1 xml:id="chm.specialities.prefs">
   <title>User Preferences</title>

   <para>
    Most of the interactive features of this manual are provided by the
    viewer application (including full text search, index, favorites
    list), but we extended this list with PHP Manual specific tools.
    All these can be adjusted to your needs using a simple desktop
    application named <filename>php_manual_prefs.exe</filename>. If you
    run this program you can see three groups of settings: Online Functions,
    Context Menu, and Skin. All your settings are stored in
    <filename>php_manual_prefs.js</filename>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Online functions enable you to have elements connected to websites.
    The two ones you can see on all manual pages are "This page online"
    and "Report a bug". As you can figure out the first one shows you
    the same page in the online manual, the second one opens a page
    from <link xlink:href="&url.php.bugs;">&url.php.bugs;</link> and prefills
    some bug data for you. You need to select a mirror site to use for
    "php.net sensitive" online functions. We recommend choosing a close
    mirror site to get the best speed. Other components that may be
    limited by this online functions setting include context menu items
    opening new websites ("Google search selection" for example).
    Custom designs may also include elements restricted by this setting.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    The context menu settings enables you to choose which context menu
    you prefer. This application provides you with an option to define
    your own context menu adding elements to it from a predefined set.
    You can have this custom context menu for the right click of your
    mouse, and have the original menu for CTRL+right click, or the
    opposite way. Three special types of custom context menu items exist:
    <table>
     <title>Context menu items</title>
     <tgroup cols="3">
      <thead>
       <row>
        <entry>Type</entry>
        <entry>Examples</entry>
        <entry>Comments</entry>
       </row>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
       <row>
        <entry>Page Jump</entry>
        <entry>Function Reference, Function Index</entry>
        <entry>
         These items jump to a specific page in the CHM. Page Jump options are not
         restricted to point inside the CHM though. They can point to websites or
         other resources. Page jump options with a protocol part in the URL open
         in new window.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>Function Call</entry>
        <entry>Print page, Select all, Copy selection to clipboard, Google Search Selection</entry>
        <entry>
         These are "function calls" for internally defined context
         menu functions. The last two examples have the speciality that they
         only show up in the menu if you rightclicked on a selection.
         Currently there is no way to extend the context menu with skin
         defined functions.
        </entry>
       </row>
       <row>
        <entry>Special display</entry>
        <entry>Google SearchBox, AlltheWeb SearchBox</entry>
        <entry>
         These are displayed as HTML forms, where you can enter search
         keywords, press ENTER, and receive a new window with the search
         issued in the appropriate search engine. Currently there is no
         way to extend the set of specially displayed context menu items.
        </entry>
       </row>
      </tbody>
     </tgroup>
    </table>
    Possible context menu elements and their "abstract implementations" are
    stored in <filename>context.ini</filename>. You have the ability to add
    possible page jump options there, but there is no way currently to extend
    the context menu system with user (skin) defined functions. The possible
    mirror sites are listed in <filename>mirrors.ini</filename>. Feel free to
    suggest more bundled context menu items to us at
    <link xlink:href="mailto:&email.php.doc.chm;">&email.php.doc.chm;</link>.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    The skins setting enables you to choose from the two bundled default
    skins, or from any user defined skins. The Low skin is optimized to
    display correctly at any small size, the High skin is optimized for
    your viewing pleasure. Other skins may be developed according to our
    <link linkend="chm.skins">skins development guide</link>. The recommended
    place for skins on the file system is the <filename>skins/SKINNAME</filename>
    subfolder of the PHP Manual directory. Though this is not required, some
    skins may define other rules (not recommended). We included sample
    skins for you to see examples of how to develop skins for the PHP Manual.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    You have three buttons to choose from at the bottom. The Apply button
    applies your changes without exiting, the OK button applies and closes
    the application, the Cancel button does not modify your settings and
    closes the program.
   </para>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1 xml:id="chm.specialities.presentation">
   <title>Presentational Specialities</title>
   
   <para>
    This edition of the PHP Manual is highly optimized for screen
    presentation. Skins may be developed to better support printing,
    as this was not the goal of the included skins. This approach
    allowed us to make many modifications to the presentation of
    different parts of the manual.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    The first thing you'll notice is that all examples are color coded,
    using the PHP function <function>show_source</function>. The actual
    colors used are defined by CSS classes. Examples also have links to
    PHP functions used in them to provide quick access to reference
    material. All code examples have a "copy to clipboard" link by the
    side of them with which you can copy the text contents of the example
    to the clipboard.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    External links are marked with a special &raquo; sign, and open in
    a new browser window. We also included the "path to this page"
    information on all pages for you to easily identify where you are
    and navigate as needed.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    Other parts of the manual are quite similar to the online ones by
    default, though custom skins can modify many elements on the pages.
