  <title>Migrating from PHP 3 to PHP 4</title>
  <simpara>
   Migration from PHP 3 to PHP 4 is relatively easy, and should
   not require you to change your code in any way.  There are
   minor incompatibilities between the two versions;  You may want
   to check the incompatibilities list to make sure that you're
   indeed not affected by them (the chances you're affected by
   these incompatibilities are extremely slim).
  </simpara>
  
  <sect2 id="migration.php4.with-php3">
   <title>Running PHP 3 and PHP 4 concurrently</title>
   <simpara>
    Recent operating systems provide the ability to perform
    versioning and scoping. This features make it possible to let
    PHP 3 and PHP 4 run as concurrent modules in one Apache server.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    This feature is known to work on the following platforms: 
   </simpara>
   <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><simpara>Linux with recent binutils (binutils 2.9.1.0.25 tested) </simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>Solaris 2.5 or better</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>FreeBSD (3.2, 4.0 tested)</simpara></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    To enable it, configure PHP3 and PHP4 to use APXS
    (--with-apxs) and the necessary link extensions
    (--enable-versioning). Otherwise, all standard installations
    instructions apply. For example:
    <informalexample><programlisting>
$ ./configure \
  --with-apxs=/apache/bin/apxs \
  --enable-versioning \
  --with-mysql \
  --enable-track-vars
</programlisting></informalexample>

     The MIME types recognized by the PHP module have changed.
     <informalexample><programlisting>
application/x-httpd-php3        --&gt;    application/x-httpd-php
application/x-httpd-php3-source --&gt;    application/x-httpd-php-source
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    <para>
     You can make your configuration files work with both versions
     of PHP (depending on which one is currently compiled into the
     server), using the following syntax:
     <informalexample><programlisting>
AddType  application/x-httpd-php3        .php3
AddType  application/x-httpd-php3-source .php3s

AddType  application/x-httpd-php         .php
AddType  application/x-httpd-php-source  .phps
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    <simpara>
     In addition,  the PHP directive names for Apache have changed.
    </simpara>
    <para>
     Starting with PHP 4.0, there are only four Apache directives
     that relate to PHP:
     <informalexample><programlisting>
php_value [PHP directive name] [value]
php_flag [PHP directive name] [On|Off]
php_admin_value [PHP directive name] [value]
php_admin_flag [PHP directive name] [On|Off]
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    <simpara>
     There are two differences between the Admin values and the non admin values:
    </simpara>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem><simpara>Admin values (or flags) can only appear in the server-wide apache configuration files (e.g., httpd.conf).</simpara></listitem>
     <listitem><simpara>Standard values (or flags) cannot control certain PHP directives, for example - safe mode (if you could override safe mode settings in .htaccess files, it would defeat safe-mode's purpose).  In contrast, Admin values can modify the value of any PHP directive.</simpara></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <simpara>
     To make the transition process easier, PHP 4.0 is bundled with scripts that automatically convert your Apache configuration and .htaccess files to work with both PHP 3.0 and PHP 4.0. These scripts do NOT convert the mime type lines! You have to convert these yourself.
    </simpara>
    <para>
     To convert your Apache configuration files, run the apconf-conv.sh script (available in the scripts/apache/ directory).  For example:
     <informalexample><programlisting>
~/php4/scripts/apache:#  ./apconf-conv.sh /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    <simpara>
     Your original configuration file will be saved in httpd.conf.orig.
    </simpara>
    <para>
     To convert your .htaccess files, run the aphtaccess-conv.sh script (available in the scripts/apache/ directory as well):
     <informalexample><programlisting>
~/php4/scripts/apache:#  find / -name .htaccess -exec ./aphtaccess-conv.sh {} \;
</programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>
    <simpara>
     Likewise, your old .htaccess files will be saved with an .orig prefix.
    </simpara>
    <simpara>
     The conversion scripts require awk to be installed.

  <title>Migrating from PHP/FI 2.0 to PHP 3.0</title>

  <sect2 id="migration-about">
   <title>About the incompatibilities in 3.0</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP 3.0 is rewritten from the ground up.  It has a proper parser
    that is much more robust and consistent than 2.0's.  3.0 is also
    significantly faster, and uses less memory.  However, some of
    these improvements have not been possible without compatibility
    changes, both in syntax and functionality.</simpara>

   <simpara>
    In addition, PHP's developers have tried to clean up both PHP's
    syntax and semantics in version 3.0, and this has also caused some
    incompatibilities.  In the long run, we believe that these changes
    are for the better.</simpara>

   <simpara>
    This chapter will try to guide you through the incompatibilities
    you might run into when going from PHP/FI 2.0 to PHP 3.0 and help
    you resolve them.  New features are not mentioned here unless
    necessary.</simpara>

   <simpara>
    A conversion program that can automatically convert your old
    PHP/FI 2.0 scripts exists.  It can be found in the <filename class="directory">convertor</filename> subdirectory of the PHP 3.0
    distribution.  This program only catches the syntax changes though,
    so you should read this chapter carefully anyway.</simpara></sect2>

  <sect2 id="migration-startendtags">
   <title>Start/end tags</title>

   <para>
    The first thing you probably will notice is that PHP's start and end
    tags have changed.  The old <literal>&lt;? &gt;</literal> form has been
    replaced by three new possible forms:
    <example>
     <title>Migration: old start/end tags</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;? echo "This is PHP/FI 2.0 code.\n"; &gt;
</programlisting></example>

    As of version 2.0, PHP/FI also supports this variation:

    <example><title>Migration: first new start/end tags</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;? echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n"; ?&gt;
</programlisting></example>

    Notice that the end tag now consists of a question mark and a
    greater-than character instead of just greater-than.  However, if
    you plan on using XML on your server, you will get problems with
    the first new variant, because PHP may try to execute the XML
    markup in XML documents as PHP code.  Because of this, the
    following variation was introduced:

    <example><title>Migration: second new start/end tags</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;?php echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n"; ?&gt;
</programlisting></example>

    Some people have had problems with editors that don't understand
    the processing instruction tags at all.  Microsoft FrontPage is one
    such editor, and as a workaround for these, the following variation
    was introduced as well:

    <example><title>Migration: third new start/end tags</title>
     <programlisting>
&lt;script language="php"&gt;

  echo "This is PHP 3.0 code!\n";

&lt;/script&gt;
</programlisting></example></para></sect2>


  <sect2 id="migration-if-endif">
   <title>if..endif syntax</title>

   <para>
    The `alternative' way to write if/elseif/else statements, using if();
    elseif(); else; endif; cannot be efficiently implemented without
    adding a large amount of complexity to the 3.0 parser.  Because of
    this, the syntax has been changed:
    <example>
     <title>Migration: old if..endif syntax</title>
     <programlisting>
if ($foo);
    echo "yep\n";
elseif ($bar);
    echo "almost\n";
else;
    echo "nope\n";
endif;
</programlisting></example>
    <example>
     <title>Migration: new if..endif syntax</title>
     <programlisting>
if ($foo):
    echo "yep\n";
elseif ($bar):
    echo "almost\n";
else:
    echo "nope\n";
endif;
</programlisting></example>

    Notice that the semicolons have been replaced by colons in all
    statements but the one terminating the expression (endif).</para></sect2>

  <sect2 id="migration-while">
   <title>while syntax</title>
   <para>
    Just like with if..endif, the syntax of while..endwhile has changed
    as well:
    <example><title>Migration: old while..endwhile syntax</title>
    <programlisting>
while ($more_to_come);
    ...
endwhile;
</programlisting></example>
    <example><title>Migration: new while..endwhile syntax</title>
    <programlisting>
while ($more_to_come):
    ...
endwhile;
</programlisting></example>
   </para>
   <warning>
    <simpara>
     If you use the old while..endwhile syntax in PHP 3.0, you will get
     a never-ending loop.
    </simpara>
   </warning></sect2>

  <sect2 id="migration-expr">
   <title>Expression types</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP/FI 2.0 used the left side of expressions to determine what type
    the result should be.  PHP 3.0 takes both sides into account when
    determining result types, and this may cause 2.0 scripts to behave
    unexpectedly in 3.0.</simpara>
   <simpara></simpara>

   <para>
    Consider this example:
    <informalexample><programlisting>
$a[0]=5;
$a[1]=7;

$key = key($a);
while ("" != $key) {
    echo "$keyn";
    next($a);
}
</programlisting></informalexample>

    In PHP/FI 2.0, this would display both of $a's indices.  In PHP
    3.0, it wouldn't display anything.  The reason is that in PHP 2.0,
    because the left argument's type was string, a string comparison
    was made, and indeed <literal>""</literal> does not equal
    <literal>"0"</literal>, and the loop went through.  In PHP 3.0,
    when a string is compared with an integer, an integer comparison is
    made (the string is converted to an integer).  This results in
    comparing <literal>atoi("")</literal> which is
    <literal>0</literal>, and <literal>variablelist</literal> which is
    also <literal>0</literal>, and since <literal>0==0</literal>, the
    loop doesn't go through even once.

   </para>
   <para>
    The fix for this is simple.  Replace the while statement with:
    <informalexample><programlisting>
while ((string)$key != "") {
</programlisting></informalexample></para></sect2>


  <sect2 id="migration-errors">
   <title>Error messages have changed</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP 3.0's error messages are usually more accurate than 2.0's were,
    but you no longer get to see the code fragment causing the error.
    You will be supplied with a file name and a line number for the
    error, though.
   </simpara></sect2>


  <sect2 id="migration-booleval">
   <title>Short-circuited boolean evaluation</title>
   <simpara>
    In PHP 3.0 boolean evaluation is short-circuited.  This means that
    in an expression like <literal>(1 || test_me())</literal>, the
    function <function>test_me</function> would not be executed since
    nothing can change the result of the expression after the
    <literal>1</literal>.</simpara>
     
   <simpara>
    This is a minor compatibility issue, but may cause unexpected
    side-effects.</simpara></sect2>


  <sect2 id="migration-truefalse">
   <title>Function true/false return values</title>
   <simpara>
    Most internal functions have been rewritten so they return TRUE
    when successful and FALSE when failing, as opposed to 0 and -1 in
    PHP/FI 2.0, respectively.  The new behaviour allows for more
    logical code, like <literal>$fp = fopen("/your/file") or
     fail("darn!");</literal>.  Because PHP/FI 2.0 had no clear rules
    for what functions should return when they failed, most such
    scripts will probably have to be checked manually after using the
    2.0 to 3.0 convertor.</simpara>
   <para>
    <example>
     <title>Migration from 2.0: return values, old code</title>
     <programlisting>
$fp = fopen($file, "r");
if ($fp == -1);
    echo("Could not open $file for reading&lt;br&gt;\n");
endif;
</programlisting>
    </example>
    <example>
     <title>Migration from 2.0: return values, new code</title>
     <programlisting>
$fp = @fopen($file, "r") or print("Could not open $file for reading&lt;br&gt;\n");
