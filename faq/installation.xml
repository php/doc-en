    <question>
     <para>
      Why shouldn't I use Apache2 with a threaded MPM in a production environment?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      PHP is glue. It is the glue used to build cool web applications by
      sticking dozens of 3rd-party libraries together and making it all appear
      as one coherent entity through an intuitive and easy to learn language
      interface. The flexibility and power of PHP relies on the stability and
      robustness of the underlying platform. It needs a working OS, a working
      web server and working 3rd-party libraries to glue together. When any of
      these stop working PHP needs ways to identify the problems and fix them
      quickly. When you make the underlying framework more complex by not having
      completely separate execution threads, completely separate memory
      segments and a strong sandbox for each request to play in, feet of
      clay are introduced into PHP's system.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you feel you have to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration
      where PHP is running in its own memory space.  
     </para>
     <para>
      And finally, this warning against using a threaded MPM is not as strong for
      Windows systems because most libraries on that platform tend to be threadsafe.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.installation.phpini">
    <question>
     <para>
      Unix/Windows: Where should my &php.ini; file be
      located?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      By default on Unix it should be in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>
      which is <filename>&lt;install-path&gt;/lib</filename>.
      Most people will want to change this at compile-time with the 
      <link linkend="configure.with-config-file-path">--with-config-file-path</link>
      flag. You would, for example, set it with something like:
      <programlisting role="shell">
--with-config-file-path=/etc
      </programlisting>
      And then you would copy <filename>php.ini-dist</filename> from 
      the distribution to <filename>/etc/php.ini</filename> and
      edit it to make any local changes you want.
     </para>
      <programlisting role="shell">
--with-config-file-scan-dir=PATH 
      </programlisting>
     <para>
      On Windows the default path for the &php.ini; file is the Windows
      directory. If you're using the Apache webserver, &php.ini; is first
      searched in the Apaches install directory, e.g. <filename>c:\program
      files\apache group\apache</filename>. This way you can have
      different &php.ini; files for different versions of Apache on the same
      machine.

      This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem
      and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
      this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
      a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
      helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
      to help the developers pinpoint the problem.  If you are using
      PHP as an Apache module try something like:

    <question>
     <para>
      Unix: I installed PHP 3 using RPMS, but it doesn't compile with
      the database support I need! What's going on here?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Due to the way PHP 3 built, it is not easy to build a
      complete flexible PHP RPM.  This issue is addressed in PHP 4.
      For PHP 3, we currently suggest you use the mechanism described in the
      INSTALL.REDHAT file in the PHP distribution.  If you insist on using
      an RPM version of PHP 3, read on...
     </para>
     <para>
      The RPM packagers are setting up the RPMS to install
      without database support to simplify installations <emphasis>and</emphasis>
      because RPMS use /usr/ instead of the standard /usr/local/ directory for
      files. You need to tell the RPM spec file which databases to support
      and the location of the top-level of your database server.
     </para>
     <para>
      This example will explain the process of adding support for the
      popular MySQL database server, using the mod installation for Apache.
     </para>
     <para>
      Of course all of this information can be adjusted for any database
      server that PHP supports. We will assume you installed MySQL and Apache
      completely with RPMS for this example as well.

        <para>
         First remove mod_php3 :

       </listitem>

        </para>
        <para>
         In the %build section add the database support you want, and the path.
        </para>
        <para>
         For MySQL  you would add
         <option role="configure">--with-mysql=/usr</option>
         The %build section will look something like this:
         <programlisting role="shell">

--with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=/usr/lib \
--enable-debug=no \

--with-mysql=/usr \
--with-system-regex

        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Once this modification is made then build the binary rpm as follows:
         <programlisting role="shell">
rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec
         </programlisting>
        </para>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <para>
         Then install the rpm
         <programlisting role="shell">
rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mod_php3-3.0.5-2.i386.rpm
         </programlisting>
        </para>
       </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Make sure you restart Apache, and you now have PHP 3 with MySQL support
      using RPM's. Note that it is probably much easier to just build
      from the distribution tarball of PHP 3 and follow the instructions in
      <filename>INSTALL.REDHAT</filename> found in that distribution.

      Apache FrontPage extensions?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions. The problem
      is that the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures,
      that PHP relies on. Recompiling PHP (using 'make clean ; make')
      after the FP patch is applied would solve the problem.

     <para>
      Do a 'view source' in the web browser and you will probably
      find that you can see the source code of your PHP script.
      This means that the web server did not send the script to
      PHP for interpretation. Something is wrong with the server
      configuration - double check the server configuration against
      the PHP installation instructions.

    <answer>
     <para>
      Something went wrong when the server tried to run PHP. To

      change to the directory containing the PHP executable
      (<filename>php.exe</filename> on Windows) and run
      <command>php -i</command>. If PHP has any problems running,
      then a suitable error message will be displayed which will
      give you a clue as to what needs to be done next. If you
      get a screen full of HTML codes (the output of the
      <function>phpinfo</function> function) then PHP is working,

      The PHP manual used to promote the copying of files into the Windows 
      system directory, this is because this directory  
      (<filename>C:\Windows</filename>, <filename>C:\WINNT</filename>, etc.)
      is by default in the systems PATH.  Copying files into the Windows 
      system directory has long since been deprecated and may cause problems.

      How do I make the &php.ini; file available to PHP on windows?

    <answer>
     <para>
      There are several ways of doing this. If you are using Apache, read
      their installation specific instructions (<link
       linkend="install.windows.apache1">Apache 1</link>, <link
       linkend="install.windows.apache2">Apache 2</link>), otherwise you must
      set the <varname>PHPRC</varname> environment variable:

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.installation.apache.multiviews">
    <question>
     <para>
      Is it possible to use Apache content negotiation (MultiViews option)
      with PHP?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      If links to PHP files include extension, everything works perfect. This
      FAQ is only for the case when links to PHP files don't include extension
      and you want to use content negotiation to choose PHP files from URL
      with no extension.
      In this case, replace the line <literal>AddType application/x-httpd-php
      .php</literal> with:
      <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
# PHP 4
AddHandler php-script php
AddType text/html php

# PHP 5
AddHandler php5-script php
AddType text/html php
]]>
     </programlisting>
     This solution doesn't work for Apache 1 as PHP module doesn't catch
     <literal>php-script</literal>.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.installation.requestmethods">
    <question>
     <para>
      Is PHP limited to process GET and POST request methods only?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, it is possible to handle any request method, e.g. CONNECT. Proper
      response status can be sent with <function>header</function>.
      If only GET and POST methods should be handled, it can be achieved with
      this Apache configuration:
      <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
<LimitExcept GET POST>
Deny from all
</LimitExcept>
]]>
     </programlisting>
