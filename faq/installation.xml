  <para>
   This section holds common questions about the way to install
   PHP. PHP is available for almost any OS (except maybe for 
   MacOS before OSX), and almost any web server.
  </para>
  <para>
   To install PHP, follow the instructions in the 
   <ulink url="&url.file.installation;">INSTALL</ulink>
   file located in the distribution. Windows users should also read the 
   <ulink url="&url.file.readmewin;">install.txt</ulink>
   file. There are also some helpful hints for Windows users

    <question>
     <para>
      Unix/Windows: Where should my &php.ini; file be
      located?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      By default on UNIX it should be in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>
      which is <filename>&lt;install-path&gt;/lib</filename>.
      Most people will want to change this at compile-time with the 
      <link linkend="install.configure.with-config-file-path">--with-config-file-path</link>
      flag. You would, for example, set it with something like:
      <programlisting>
--with-config-file-path=/etc
      </programlisting>
      And then you would copy <filename>php.ini-dist</filename> from 
      the distribution to <filename>/etc/php.ini</filename> and
      edit it to make any local changes you want.
     </para>
      <programlisting>
--with-config-file-scan-dir=PATH 
      </programlisting>
     <para>
      On Windows the default path for the &php.ini; file is the Windows
      directory. If you're using the Apache webserver, &php.ini; is first
      searched in the Apaches install directory, e.g. <filename>c:\program
      files\apache group\apache</filename>. This way you can have
      different &php.ini; files for different versions of Apache on the same
      machine.

      Unix: I installed PHP, but every time I load a document, I get the

      This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem
      and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
      this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
      a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
      helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
      to help the developers pinpoint the problem.  If you are using
      PHP as an Apache module try something like:
      <itemizedlist>

      If your script uses the regular expression functions
      (<function>ereg</function> and friends), you should make sure 
      that you compiled PHP and Apache with the same regular 
      expression package. This should happen automatically with
      PHP and Apache 1.3.x

     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Assuming you installed both Apache and PHP from RPM packages, 
      you need to uncomment or add some or all of the following lines
      in your &httpd.conf; file:
      <programlisting>
# Extra Modules
AddModule mod_php.c
AddModule mod_php3.c
AddModule mod_perl.c

# Extra Modules
LoadModule php_module         modules/mod_php.so
LoadModule php3_module        modules/libphp3.so     /* for PHP 3 */
LoadModule php4_module        modules/libphp4.so     /* for PHP 4 */
LoadModule perl_module        modules/libperl.so
      </programlisting>
      And add:
      <programlisting>
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3    /* for PHP 3 */
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php      /* for PHP 4 */
      </programlisting>
      ... to the global properties, or to the properties of the 
      VirtualDomain you want to have PHP support added to.

   <qandaentry id="faq.installation.compile">
    <question>
     <para>
      Unix: I installed PHP 3 using RPMS, but it doesn't compile with
      the database support I need! What's going on here?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Due to the way PHP 3 built, it is not easy to build a
      complete flexible PHP RPM.  This issue is addressed in PHP 4.
      For PHP 3, we currently suggest you use the mechanism described in the
      INSTALL.REDHAT file in the PHP distribution.  If you insist on using
      an RPM version of PHP 3, read on...
     </para>
     <para>
      The RPM packagers are setting up the RPMS to install
      without database support to simplify installations <emphasis>and</emphasis>
      because RPMS use /usr/ instead of the standard /usr/local/ directory for
      files. You need to tell the RPM spec file which databases to support
      and the location of the top-level of your database server.
     </para>
     <para>
      This example will explain the process of adding support for the
      popular MySQL database server, using the mod installation for Apache.
     </para>
     <para>
      Of course all of this information can be adjusted for any database
      server that PHP supports. We will assume you installed MySQL and Apache
      completely with RPMS for this example as well.
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
	      <para>
         First remove mod_php3 : 
         <programlisting>
rpm -e mod_php3
         </programlisting>
	      </para>
 	     </listitem>
 	     <listitem>
	      <para>
         Then get the source rpm and INSTALL it, NOT --rebuild
         <programlisting>
rpm -Uvh mod_php3-3.0.5-2.src.rpm
         </programlisting>
  	    </para>
 	     </listitem>
 	     <listitem>
	      <para>
	       Then edit the <filename>/usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec</filename> file
	      </para>
	      <para>
         In the %build section add the database support you want, and the path.
	      </para>
	      <para>
         For MySQL  you would add
         <programlisting>
--with-mysql=/usr \
         </programlisting>
         The %build section will look something like this:
         <programlisting>
	./configure --prefix=/usr \
	--with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
	--with-config-file-path=/usr/lib \
	--enable-debug=no \
	--enable-safe-mode \
	--with-exec-dir=/usr/bin \
	--with-mysql=/usr \
	--with-system-regex
         </programlisting>
	      </para>
 	     </listitem>
 	     <listitem>
	      <para>
	       Once this modification is made then build the binary rpm as follows:
         <programlisting>
rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec
         </programlisting>
	      </para>
 	     </listitem>
 	     <listitem>
	      <para>
	       Then install the rpm
         <programlisting>
rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mod_php3-3.0.5-2.i386.rpm
         </programlisting>
	      </para>
 	     </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Make sure you restart Apache, and you now have PHP 3 with MySQL support
      using RPM's. Note that it is probably much easier to just build
      from the distribution tarball of PHP 3 and follow the instructions in
      <filename>INSTALL.REDHAT</filename> found in that distribution.

   <qandaentry id="faq.installation.frontpage">
    <question>
     <para>
      Unix: I patched Apache with the FrontPage extensions patch, and
      suddenly PHP stopped working. Is PHP incompatible with the
      Apache FrontPage extensions?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions. The problem
      is that the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures,
      that PHP relies on. Recompiling PHP (using 'make clean ; make')
      after the FP patch is applied would solve the problem.

    <question>
     <para>
      Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I try to
      access a PHP script file via my browser, I get a blank screen.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Do a 'view source' in the web browser and you will probably
      find that you can see the source code of your PHP script.
      This means that the web server did not send the script to
      PHP for interpretation. Something is wrong with the server
      configuration - double check the server configuration against
      the PHP installation instructions.

   <qandaentry id="faq.installation.500error">
    <question>

      Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when try to
      access a PHP script file via my browser, I get a
      server 500 error.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Something went wrong when the server tried to run PHP. To
      get to see a sensible error message, from the command line,
      change to the directory containing the PHP executable
      (<filename>php.exe</filename> on Windows) and run
      <literal>php -i</literal>. If PHP has any problems running,
      then a suitable error message will be displayed which will
      give you a clue as to what needs to be done next. If you
      get a screen full of HTML codes (the output of the
      <function>phpinfo</function> function) then PHP is working,
      and your problem may be related to your server configuration
      which you should double check.

    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      This error message means that PHP failed to output anything
      at all. To get to see a sensible error message, from the
      command line, change to the directory containing the PHP
      executable (<filename>php.exe</filename> on Windows) and run

        for IIS you can trap this error by ticking the 'check file
        exists' box when setting up the script mappings in the
        Internet Services Manager. If a script file does not exist
        then the server will return a 404 error instead. There is
        also the additional benefit that IIS will do any

    <answer>
     <para>
      Make sure any user who needs to run a PHP script has the rights
      to run <filename>php.exe</filename>! IIS uses an anonymous user
      which is added at the time IIS is installed. This user needs
      rights to <filename>php.exe</filename>. Also, any authenticated
      user will also need rights to execute <filename>php.exe</filename>.
      And for IIS4 you need to tell it that PHP is a script engine.

      You must set the <link linkend="ini.cgi.force-redirect">

      in that directory.  If &php.ini; is included within the PATH than 
      it is being read.
