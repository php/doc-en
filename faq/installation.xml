   This section holds common questions about the way to install
   PHP. PHP is available for almost any OS (except maybe for 
   MacOS before OSX), and almost any web server.

   To install PHP, follow the instructions in <xref linkend="install"/>.

    <question>
     <para>
      Why shouldn't I use Apache2 with a threaded MPM in a production environment?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      PHP is glue. It is the glue used to build cool web applications by
      sticking dozens of 3rd-party libraries together and making it all appear
      as one coherent entity through an intuitive and easy to learn language
      interface. The flexibility and power of PHP relies on the stability and
      robustness of the underlying platform. It needs a working OS, a working
      web server and working 3rd-party libraries to glue together. When any of
      these stop working PHP needs ways to identify the problems and fix them
      quickly. When you make the underlying framework more complex by not having
      completely separate execution threads, completely separate memory
      segments and a strong sandbox for each request to play in, feet of
      clay are introduced into PHP's system.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you feel you have to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI configuration
      where PHP is running in its own memory space.  
     </para>
     <para>
      And finally, this warning against using a threaded MPM is not as strong for
      Windows systems because most libraries on that platform tend to be threadsafe.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.installation.phpini">
    <question>
     <para>
      Unix/Windows: Where should my &php.ini; file be
      located?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      By default on Unix it should be in <filename>/usr/local/lib</filename>
      which is <filename>&lt;install-path&gt;/lib</filename>.
      Most people will want to change this at compile-time with the 
      <link linkend="configure.with-config-file-path">--with-config-file-path</link>
      flag. You would, for example, set it with something like:
      <programlisting role="shell">
--with-config-file-path=/etc
      </programlisting>
      And then you would copy <filename>php.ini-dist</filename> from 
      the distribution to <filename>/etc/php.ini</filename> and
      edit it to make any local changes you want.
     </para>
      <programlisting role="shell">
--with-config-file-scan-dir=PATH 
      </programlisting>
     <para>
      On Windows the default path for the &php.ini; file is the Windows
      directory. If you're using the Apache webserver, &php.ini; is first
      searched in the Apaches install directory, e.g. <filename>c:\program
      files\apache group\apache</filename>. This way you can have
      different &php.ini; files for different versions of Apache on the same
      machine.

      This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem
      and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
      this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
      a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
      helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
      to help the developers pinpoint the problem.  If you are using
      PHP as an Apache module try something like:

    <question>
     <para>
      Unix: I patched Apache with the FrontPage extensions patch, and
      suddenly PHP stopped working. Is PHP incompatible with the
      Apache FrontPage extensions?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions. The problem
      is that the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures,
      that PHP relies on. Recompiling PHP (using 'make clean ; make')
      after the FP patch is applied would solve the problem.

     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Do a 'view source' in the web browser and you will probably
      find that you can see the source code of your PHP script.
      This means that the web server did not send the script to
      PHP for interpretation. Something is wrong with the server
      configuration - double check the server configuration against
      the PHP installation instructions.

      server 500 error.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Something went wrong when the server tried to run PHP. To
      get to see a sensible error message, from the command line,
      change to the directory containing the PHP executable
      (<filename>php.exe</filename> on Windows) and run
      <command>php -i</command>. If PHP has any problems running,
      then a suitable error message will be displayed which will
      give you a clue as to what needs to be done next. If you
      get a screen full of HTML codes (the output of the
      <function>phpinfo</function> function) then PHP is working,
      and your problem may be related to your server configuration
      which you should double check.

      This has actually nothing to do with PHP, but with the MySQL

      Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I to access

    <answer>
     <para>
      This error message means that PHP failed to output anything
      at all. To get to see a sensible error message, from the
      command line, change to the directory containing the PHP
      executable (<filename>php.exe</filename> on Windows) and run
      <command>php -i</command>. If PHP has any problems running,

     <para>
      Make sure any user who needs to run a PHP script has the rights
      to run <filename>php.exe</filename>! IIS uses an anonymous user

      rights to <filename>php.exe</filename>. Also, any authenticated
      user will also need rights to execute <filename>php.exe</filename>.
      And for IIS4 you need to tell it that PHP is a script engine.

      This will tell you where PHP is looking for &php.ini; and
      whether or not it's being read.  If just a directory PATH exists,

      in that directory.  If &php.ini; is included within the PATH,

      If links to PHP files include extension, everything works perfect. This
      FAQ is only for the case when links to PHP files don't include extension
      and you want to use content negotiation to choose PHP files from URL
      with no extension.
      In this case, replace the line <literal>AddType application/x-httpd-php
      .php</literal> with:
      <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
# PHP 4
AddHandler php-script php
AddType text/html php

# PHP 5
AddHandler php5-script php
AddType text/html php
]]>
     </programlisting>
     This solution doesn't work for Apache 1 as PHP module doesn't catch
     <literal>php-script</literal>.

    <question>
     <para>
      Is PHP limited to process GET and POST request methods only?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, it is possible to handle any request method, e.g. CONNECT. Proper
      response status can be sent with <function>header</function>.
      If only GET and POST methods should be handled, it can be achieved with
      this Apache configuration:
      <programlisting role="apache-conf">
<![CDATA[
<LimitExcept GET POST>
Deny from all
</LimitExcept>
]]>
     </programlisting>
