   This section holds common questions about relation between
   PHP and databases. Yes, PHP can access virtually any
   database available today.

    <question>
     <para>
      I heard it's possible to access Microsoft SQL Server from PHP. How?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      On Unix machines you can use <link linkend="ref.pdo-odbc">PDO_ODBC</link>
      or the <link linkend="book.uodbc">Unified ODBC API</link>.
     </para>
     <para>
      On Windows machines you can also use <link linkend="ref.pdo-sqlsrv">PDO_SQLSRV</link>
      or <link linkend="book.sqlsrv">SQLSRV</link>.

    <question>
     <para>Can I access Microsoft Access databases?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
      entirely under Windows 9x/Me, or NT/2000, where you can use
      ODBC and Microsoft's ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS Access
      on a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
      <link xlink:href="&url.openlink;">OpenLink Software</link> has Unix-based
      ODBC drivers that can do this.
     </para>
     <para>
      Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
      Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
      then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
      built in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
      and PHP both understand, such as flat files or dBase databases.
      On this point Tim Hayes from OpenLink software writes:
      <blockquote>
       <para>
        Using another database as an intermediary is not a good idea, when you can
        use ODBC from PHP straight to your database - i.e. with OpenLink's drivers. If
        you do need to use an intermediary file format, OpenLink have now released
        Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other Unix platforms.

      One option that has proved successful is to use MySQL and its
      MyODBC drivers on Windows and synchronizing the databases. Steve Lawrence

         No special configuration required except when you set up a database, and configure the
         user account, you should put % in the host field, or the host name of the
         Windows computer you wish to access MySQL with. Make a note of your server

         Now the fun part! Create a new access database. In the table
         window right click and select Link Tables, or under the file
         menu option, select Get External Data and then Link Tables.
         When the file browser box comes up, select files of type: ODBC.
         Select System dsn and the name of your dsn created in step 3.
         Select the table to link, press OK, and presto! You can now
         open the table and add/delete/edit data on your MySQL server!
         You can also build queries, import/export tables to MySQL,
         build forms and reports, etc.

        <simpara>
         You can construct your tables in Access and export them
         to MySQL, then link them back in. That makes table
         creation quick.
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         When creating tables in Access, you must have a primary
         key defined in order to have write access to the table in
         access. Make sure you create a primary key in MySQL before
         linking in access
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         If you change a table in MySQL, you have to re-link it
         in Access. Go to tools&gt;add-ins&gt;linked table manager,
         cruise to your ODBC DSN, and select the table to re-link
         from there. you can also move your dsn source around there,
         just hit the always prompt for new location checkbox before
         pressing OK.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.databases.mysql.deprecated">
    <question>
     <para>
      Why is the MySQL extension (ext/mysql) that I've been using for over
      10 years discouraged from use? Is it deprecated? What do I use instead?
      How can I migrate?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      There are three MySQL extensions, as described under the
      <link linkend="mysqlinfo.api.choosing">Choosing a MySQL API</link> section. The old API
      should not be used, it is deprecated as of PHP 5.5.0 and has been moved to PECL as of PHP 7.0.0.
      You are strongly encouraged
      to write all new code with either <link linkend="book.mysqli">mysqli</link> or
      <link linkend="ref.pdo-mysql">PDO_MySQL</link>. 
     </para>
     <para>
      Migration scripts are not available at this time, although the mysqli API contains both
      a procedural and OOP API, with the procedural version being similar to ext/mysql.
     </para>
     <para>
      It is not possible to mix the extensions. So, for example, passing a mysqli connection to
      PDO_MySQL or ext/mysql will not work.
     </para>

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.databases.mysqlresource">
    <question>
     <para>
      Why do I get an error that looks something like this:
      "Warning: 0 is not a MySQL result index in &lt;file&gt;
      on line &lt;x&gt;" or "Warning: Supplied argument is not
      a valid MySQL result resource in &lt;file&gt; on line &lt;x&gt;"?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You are trying to use a result identifier that is 0. The 0 indicates
      that your query failed for some reason. You need to check for errors
      after submitting a query and before you attempt to use the returned
      result identifier.  The proper way to do this is with code similar
      to the following:
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv");
if (!$result) {
    echo mysql_error();
    exit;
}
?>
]]>
      </programlisting>
      or
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php

$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv")
    or die("Bad query: " . mysql_error());
?>
]]>
      </programlisting>
     </para>
