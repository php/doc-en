   database available today.

      I heard it's possible to access Microsoft SQL Server from PHP. How?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      On Windows machines, you can simply use the included ODBC support
      and the correct ODBC driver.
     </para>
     <para>
      On Unix machines, you can use the Sybase-CT driver
      to access Microsoft SQL Servers because they are (at
      least mostly) protocol-compatible. Sybase has made a 
      <ulink url="&url.sybase.ctlib;">free version of the necessary
      libraries for Linux systems</ulink>. For other Unix operating
      systems, you need to contact Sybase for the correct libraries.

    <question>
     <para>Can I access Microsoft Access databases?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Yes. You already have all the tools you need if you are running
      entirely under Windows 9x/Me, or NT/2000, where you can use
      ODBC and Microsoft's ODBC drivers for Microsoft Access databases.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you are running PHP on a Unix box and want to talk to MS Access
      on a Windows box you will need Unix ODBC drivers.
      <ulink url="&url.openlink;">OpenLink Software</ulink> has Unix-based
      ODBC drivers that can do this. There is a free pilot program where you
      can download an evaluation copy that doesn't expire and prices start at
      $675 for the commercial supported version.
     </para>
     <para>
      Another alternative is to use an SQL server that has
      Windows ODBC drivers and use that to store the data, which you can
      then access from Microsoft Access (using ODBC) and PHP (using the
      built in drivers), or to use an intermediary file format that Access
      and PHP both understand, such as flat files or dBase databases.
      On this point Tim Hayes from OpenLink software writes:
      <programlisting>
      Using another database as an intermediary is not a good idea, when you can
      use ODBC from PHP straight to your database - i.e. with OpenLink's drivers. If
      you do need to use an intermediary file format, OpenLink have now released
      Virtuoso (a virtual database engine) for NT, Linux and other unix platforms.
      Please visit our <ulink url="&url.openlink;">website</ulink> for a free download.

      One option that has proven successful is to use MySQL and its
      MyODBC drivers on Windows and synchronizing the databases. Steve Lawrence

         (get it from your mirror!). No special

         user account, you should put % in the host field, or the host name of the
         Windows computer you wish to access MySQL with. Make a note of your server

         Now the fun part! Create a new access database. In the table
         window right click and select Link Tables, or under the file
         menu option, select Get External Data and then Link Tables.
         When the file browser box comes up, select files of type: ODBC.
         Select System dsn and the name of your dsn created in step 3.
         Select the table to link, press OK, and presto! You can now
         open the table and add/delete/edit data on your MySQL server!
         You can also build queries, import/export tables to MySQL,
         build forms and reports, etc.

         You can construct your tables in Access and export them
         to MySQL, then link them back in. That makes table
         creation quick.
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         When creating tables in Access, you must have a primary
         key defined in order to have write access to the table in
         access. Make sure you create a primary key in MySQL before
         linking in access
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         If you change a table in MySQL, you have to re-link it
         in Access. Go to tools&gt;add-ins&gt;linked table manager,
         cruise to your ODBC DSN, and select the table to re-link
         from there. you can also move your dsn source around there,
         just hit the always prompt for new location checkbox before
         pressing OK.

   <qandaentry id="faq.databases.upgraded">
    <question>
     <para>
      I upgraded to PHP 4, and now mysql keeps telling me
      "Warning: MySQL: Unable to save result set in ...". What's up?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Most likely what has happened is, PHP 4 was compiled with the '--with-mysql'
      option, without specifying the path to MySQL. This means PHP is using its
      built-in MySQL client library. If your system is running applications,
      such as PHP 3 as a concurrent Apache module, or auth-mysql, that use other
      versions of MySQL clients, then there is a conflict between the two
      differing versions of those clients.
     </para>
     <para>
      Recompiling PHP 4, and adding the path to MySQL to the flag,
      '<link linkend="install.configure.with-mysql">--with-mysql=/your/path/to/mysql</link>' 
      usually solves the problem.
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.databases.shared-mysql">
    <question>
     <para>
      After installing shared MySQL support, Apache dumps core as soon
      as libphp4.so is loaded. Can this be fixed?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      If your MySQL libs are linked against pthreads this will happen. Check
      using ldd. If they are, grab the MySQL tarball and compile from source,
      or recompile from the source rpm and remove the switch in the spec file
      that turns on the threaded client code. Either of these suggestions will
      fix this. Then recompile PHP with the new MySQL libs.

   <qandaentry id="faq.databases.mysqlresource">
    <question>
     <para>
      Why do I get an error that looks something like this: 
      "Warning: 0 is not a MySQL result index in &lt;file&gt; 
      on line &lt;x&gt;" or "Warning: Supplied argument is not 
      a valid MySQL result resource in &lt;file&gt; on line &lt;x&gt;?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You are trying to use a result identifier that is 0. The 0 indicates
      that your query failed for some reason. You need to check for errors
      after submitting a query and before you attempt to use the returned 
      result identifier.  The proper way to do this is with code similar
      to the following:
      <programlisting role="php">
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv");
if (!$result) {
    echo mysql_error();
    exit;
}
      </programlisting>
      or
      <programlisting role="php">
$result = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM tables_priv")
    or die("Bad query: ".mysql_error());
      </programlisting>
     </para>
