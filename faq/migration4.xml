      Migrating from PHP 3 to PHP 4
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      PHP 4 was designed to be as compatible with earlier versions of
      PHP as possible and very little functionality was broken in the
      process. If you're really unsure about compatibility you should
      install PHP 4 in a test environment and run your scripts there.

    <question>
     <para>
      Do sessions work in PHP 3?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Although <link linkend="ref.session">native session support</link>
      didn't exist in PHP 3, there are third-party applications that did
      (and still do) offer session functionality.  The most common method
      was by using <ulink url="&url.phplib;">PHPLIB</ulink>.

    <question>
     <para>
      Incompatible functions?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Since PHP 4 is basically a rewrite of the entire PHP engine there
      was very few functions that were altered and only then some of
      the more exotic ones.
