   <qandaentry id="faq.build.configure">
    <question>
     <para>
      I got the latest version of PHP using the anonymous CVS service, 
      but there's no configure script!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You have to have the GNU autoconf package installed so you can
      generate the configure script from <filename>configure.in</filename>. Just run
      <command>./buildconf</command> in the top-level directory after getting
      the sources from the CVS server. (Also, unless you run configure
      with the <literal>--enable-maintainer-mode</literal> option, the
      configure script will not automatically get rebuilt when the
      <filename>configure.in</filename> file is updated, so you should make sure to do that
      manually when you notice configure.in has changed. One symptom
      of this is finding things like @VARIABLE@ in your Makefile after
      configure or <filename>config.status</filename> is run.)

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.configuring">
    <question>
     <para>
      I'm having problems configuring PHP to work with Apache. 
      It says it can't find <filename>httpd.h</filename>, but it's right where I said it is!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You need to tell the configure/setup script the location of the
      top-level of your Apache source tree. This means that
      you want to specify <literal>--with-apache=/path/to/apache</literal>
      and <emphasis>not</emphasis> <literal>--with-apache=/path/to/apache/src</literal>.

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.lex">
    <question>
     <para>
      While configuring PHP (<literal>./configure</literal>), you come across
      an error similar to the following:

     <para>
      Be sure to read the <link linkend="install.unix">installation</link>
      instructions carefully and note that you need both flex and bison
      installed to compile PHP.  Depending on your setup you will install 
      bison and flex from either source or a package, such as a RPM.

     <para>
      This error usually comes up when one compiles the Apache
      core program as a DSO library for shared usage.  Try to
      reconfigure apache, making sure to use at least the
      following flags:

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.not-found">
    <question>
     <para>
      When I run configure, it says that it can't find the 
      include files or library for GD, gdbm, or some other package!
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You can make the configure script looks for header files and libraries
      in non-standard locations by specifying additional flags to pass to
      the C preprocessor and linker, such as:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/include LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/library ./configure
]]>
      </programlisting>
      If you're using a csh-variant for your login shell (why?), it would be:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
    env CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/include LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/library ./configure

      to link the final application complaining that it can't find some files.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Some old versions of make that don't correctly put the compiled
      versions of the files in the functions directory into that same
      directory. Try running <command>cp *.o functions</command> and then
      re-running <command>make</command> to see if that helps. If it does, you should really
      upgrade to a recent version of GNU make.

    <question>

      When linking PHP, it complains about a number of undefined references.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Take a look at the link line and make sure that all of the appropriate  
      libraries are being included at the end. Common ones that you might have
      missed are '-ldl' and any libraries required for any database support
      you included.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you're linking with Apache 1.2.x, did you remember to add the
      appropriate information to the EXTRA_LIBS line of the Configuration
      file and re-rerun Apache's Configure script? See the 
      <ulink url="&url.file.installation;">INSTALL</ulink> file that
      comes with the distribution for more information.
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.not-running">
    <question>
     <para>
      I have followed all the steps to install the Apache module version on 
      UNIX, and my PHP scripts show up in my browser or I am being asked to 
      save the file.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      This means that the PHP module is not getting invoked for some reason.
      Three things to check before asking for further help:
      <itemizedlist>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         Make sure that the httpd binary you are running is the actual 
         new httpd binary you just built.  To do this, try running: 
         <literal>/path/to/binary/httpd -l</literal>
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
         If you don't see <filename>mod_php4.c</filename> listed then
         you are not running the right binary.  Find and install the
         correct binary.
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         Make sure you have added the correct Mime Type to one of your 
         <literal>Apache .conf</literal> files.  It should be: 
         <literal>AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3</literal> (for PHP 3)
        </simpara>
        <simpara>
         or <literal>AddType application/x-httpd-php .php</literal> (for PHP 4)
        </simpara>
        <simpara> 
         Also make sure that this AddType line is not hidden away inside a
         &lt;Virtualhost&gt; or &lt;Directory&gt; block which would
         prevent it from applying to the location of your test script.
        </simpara>
       </listitem>
       <listitem>
        <simpara>
         Finally, the default location of the Apache configuration files 
         changed between Apache 1.2 and Apache 1.3.  You should check to 
         make sure that the configuration file you are adding the AddType 
         line to is actually being read. You can put an obvious syntax error
         into your httpd.conf file or some other obvious change that will 
         tell you if the file is being read correctly.

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.apxs">
    <question>
     <para>
      When I try to build PHP using <literal>--with-apxs</literal>
      I get strange error messages.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      There are three things to check here.  First, for some reason
      when Apache builds the apxs Perl script, it sometimes ends up
      getting built without the proper compiler and flags variables.
      Find your apxs script (try the command <command>which apxs</command>), 
      it's sometimes found in <filename>/usr/local/apache/bin/apxs</filename>
      or <filename>/usr/sbin/apxs</filename>.
      Open it and check for lines similar to these:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = ' ';          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = ' ';          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = ' ';          # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
]]>
      </programlisting>
      If this is what you see, you have found your problem.  They may 
      contain just spaces or other incorrect values, such as 'q()'.  Change 
      these lines to say:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
my $CFG_CFLAGS_SHLIB  = '-fpic -DSHARED_MODULE'; # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LD_SHLIB      = 'gcc';                   # substituted via Makefile.tmpl
my $CFG_LDFLAGS_SHLIB = q(-shared);              # substituted via Makefile.tmpl 
]]>
      </programlisting>
      The second possible problem should only be an issue on Red Hat 6.1
      and 6.2.  The apxs script Red Hat ships is broken.  Look for this line:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = 'modules';         # substituted via APACI install
]]>
      </programlisting>
      If you see the above line, change it to this:
      <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
my $CFG_LIBEXECDIR    = '/usr/lib/apache'; # substituted via APACI install
]]>
      </programlisting>
       Last, if you reconfigure/reinstall Apache, add a <command>make clean</command> 
       to the process after <command>./configure</command> and before <command>make</command>.
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.microtime">

     <para>
      Your system is broken.  You need to fix your <filename>/usr/include</filename> files by
      installing a glibc-devel package that matches your glibc.  This has
      absolutely nothing to do with PHP.  To prove this to yourself, try this
      simple test:
     <programlisting>
<![CDATA[
$ cat >test.c <<X
#include <sys/resource.h>
X
$ gcc -E test.c >/dev/null

   <qandaentry id="faq.build.mysql.tempnam">
    <question>
     <para>
      When compiling PHP with MySQL, configure runs fine but during
      <literal>make</literal> I get an error similar to the following:
      <emphasis>ext/mysql/libmysql/my_tempnam.o(.text+0x46): In function

    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      First, it's important to realize that this is a <literal>
      Warning</literal> and not a fatal error.  Because this is
      often the last output seen during <literal>make</literal>,
      it may seem like a fatal error but it's not.  Of course, if
      you set your compiler to die on Warnings, it will.  Also
      keep in mind that MySQL support is enabled by default.
