      Can I have the code for that?

    <answer>
     <para>
      The yellow pop-up windows on the old site were pretty cool, but
      were very difficult to maintain (since some companies seem to
      enjoy changing the way their browsers work with every new release).
    </para>
    <para>
      All the code for previous versions of the website is still available
      through CVS.  Specifically, the last version of shared.inc (that had
      all the Javascript and DHTML to do the popups) is available 
      <ulink url="&faqurl.popup;">here</ulink>.
