    <question>
     <para>
      I cannot remember the parameter order of PHP functions, are they random?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      PHP is a glue that brings together hundreds of external libraries, so sometimes
      this gets messy. However, a simple rule of thumb is as follows: 
     </para>
     <para>
      <link linkend="book.array">Array function</link> parameters are ordered
      as "<emphasis>needle, haystack</emphasis>" whereas 
      <link linkend="book.strings">String functions</link> are the opposite,
      so "<emphasis>haystack, needle</emphasis>".

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.anyform">
    <question>
     <para>
      I would like to write a generic PHP script that can handle data coming 
      from any form. How do I know which POST method variables are available?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      PHP offers many <link linkend="language.variables.predefined">
      predefined variables</link>, like the superglobal <varname>
      $_POST</varname>.  You may loop through <varname>$_POST</varname>
      as it's an associate array of all POSTed values.  For example, let's
      simply loop through it with &foreach;, 
      check for <function>empty</function> values,
      and print them out.
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
$empty = $post = array();
foreach ($_POST as $varname => $varvalue) {
    if (empty($varvalue)) {

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.addslashes">
    <question>
     <para>
      I need to convert all single-quotes (') to a backslash 
      followed by a single-quote (\'). How can I do this with a 
      regular expression?  I'd also like to convert " to \" and
      \ to \\.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Assuming this is for a database, use the escaping mechanism that
      comes with the database. For example, use 
      <function>mysql_real_escape_string</function> with MySQL and
      <function>pg_escape_string</function> with PostgreSQL. There is
      also the generic <function>addslashes</function> and
      <function>stripslashes</function> functions, that are more
      common with older PHP code.

      All my " turn into \" and my ' turn into \', how do I get rid of all 
      these unwanted backslashes?  How and why did they get there?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      Most likely the backslashes magically exist because the PHP directive 
      <link linkend="ini.magic-quotes-gpc">magic_quotes_gpc</link> is on.
      This is an old feature of PHP, and should be disabled and not relied
      upon. Also, the PHP function <function>stripslashes</function> may be
      used to strip the backslashes from the <type>string</type>.

     <para>
      How does the PHP directive register_globals affect me?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     &warn.deprecated.feature-5-3-0.removed-5-4-0;
     <para>
      First, an explanation about what this ini setting does. Let's say the
      following URL is used:
      <literal>http://example.com/foo.php?animal=cat</literal>
      and in <filename>foo.php</filename> we might have the following
      PHP code:
     </para>
     <para>
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<?php
// Using $_GET here is preferred
echo $_GET['animal'];

// For $animal to exist, register_globals must be on
// DO NOT DO THIS
echo $animal;

// This applies to all variables, so $_SERVER too
echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'];

// Again, for $PHP_SELF to exist, register_globals must be on
// DO NOT DO THIS
echo $PHP_SELF;
?>
]]>
     </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
     The code above demonstrates how register_globals creates a lot of
     variables. For years this type of coding has been frowned upon, and for
     years it's been disabled by default. So although most web hosts disable
     register_globals, there are still outdated articles, tutorials, and books
     that require it to be on. Plan accordingly.

    <note>
     <para>
      In the example above, we used an <acronym>URL</acronym> that contained
      a QUERY_STRING. Passing information like this is done through a GET HTTP
      Request, so this is why the superglobal <varname>$_GET</varname> was used.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.wrong-order">
    <question>

      When I do the following, the output is printed in 
      the wrong order: 
     <programlisting role="php">

]]>
    </programlisting>
     what's going on?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      To be able to use the results of your function in an expression (such
      as concatenating it with other strings in the example above), you need
      to <function>return</function> the value, 
      not <function>echo</function> it.

   </qandaentry>

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.newlines">
    <question>
     <para>
      Hey, what happened to my newlines?
      <programlisting role="php">
<![CDATA[
<pre>
<?php echo "This should be the first line."; ?>
<?php echo "This should show up after the new line above."; ?>
</pre>
]]>
      </programlisting>
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      In PHP, the ending for a block of code is either "?&gt;" or
      "?&gt;\n" (where \n means a newline). So in the example above,
      the echoed sentences will be on one line, because PHP omits
      the newlines after the block ending. This means that you need to
      insert an extra newline after each block of PHP code to make
      it print out one newline.
     </para>
     <para>
      Why does PHP do this? Because when formatting normal HTML, this
      usually makes your life easier because you don't want that newline,
      but you'd have to create extremely long lines or otherwise make the
      raw page source unreadable to achieve that effect.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.headers-sent">
    <question>
     <para>
      I get the message 'Warning: Cannot send session cookie - headers already
      sent...' or 'Cannot add header information - headers already sent...'.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The functions <function>header</function>, <function>setcookie</function>,
      and the <link linkend="ref.session">session 
      functions</link> need to add headers to the output stream but headers 
      can only be sent before all other content.  There can be no output
      before using these functions, output such as HTML.  The function 
      <function>headers_sent</function> will check if your script has already 
      sent headers and see also the <link linkend="ref.outcontrol">Output Control
      functions</link>.

      I need to access information in the request header directly.

     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The <function>getallheaders</function> function will do this if 
      you are running PHP as an Apache module. So, the following bit
      of code will show you all the request headers:
      <programlisting role="php">

$headers = getallheaders();
foreach ($headers as $name => $content) {

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.authentication">
    <question>
     <para>
      When I try to use authentication with IIS I get 'No Input file specified'.
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The security model of IIS is at fault here. This is a problem
      common to all CGI programs running under IIS. A workaround is
      to create a plain HTML file (not parsed by PHP) as the entry page
      into an authenticated directory. Then use a META tag to redirect
      to the PHP page, or have a link to the PHP page. PHP will
      then recognize the authentication correctly. With the ISAPI
      module, this is not a problem. This should not affect other
      NT web servers. For more information, see: 
      <link xlink:href="&url.iis;">&url.iis;</link> and the manual
      section on <link linkend="features.http-auth">HTTP Authentication

      How am I supposed to mix XML and PHP? It complains

     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      In order to embed &lt;?xml straight into your PHP code, you'll have to turn off
      short tags by having the PHP directive 
      <link linkend="ini.short-open-tag">short_open_tags</link> set to 
      <literal>0</literal>.  You cannot set this directive with 
      <function>ini_set</function>.  Regardless of 
      <link linkend="ini.short-open-tag">short_open_tags</link> being on or 
      off, you can do something like: <literal>&lt;?php echo '&lt;?xml'; ?&gt;</literal>.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.cgi-vars">
    <question>
     <para>
      I'm trying to access one of the standard CGI
      variables (such as <varname>$DOCUMENT_ROOT</varname> or
      <varname>$HTTP_REFERER</varname>) in a user-defined
      function, and it can't seem to find it. What's wrong?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      It's important to realize that the PHP directive <link
      linkend="ini.register-globals">register_globals</link> also affects
      server and environment variables.  When register_globals = off (the
      default is off since PHP 4.2.0), <varname>$DOCUMENT_ROOT</varname>
      will not exist. Instead, use <varname>$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']
      </varname>.  If register_globals = on then the variables
      <varname>$DOCUMENT_ROOT</varname> and
      <varname>$GLOBALS['DOCUMENT_ROOT']</varname> will also exist.
     </para>
     <para>
      If you're sure register_globals = on and wonder why
      <varname>$DOCUMENT_ROOT</varname> isn't available inside functions,
      it's because these are like any other variables and would 
      require <literal>global $DOCUMENT_ROOT</literal> inside the
      function.  See also the manual page on 
      <link linkend="language.variables.scope">variable scope</link>.  It's
      preferred to code with register_globals = off.

   <qandaentry xml:id="faq.using.shorthandbytes">
    <question>
     <para>
      A few PHP directives may also take on shorthand byte values, as opposed
      to only <type>integer</type> byte values.  What are all the available
      shorthand byte options?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      The available options are K (for Kilobytes), M (for Megabytes) and G (for
      Gigabytes; available since PHP 5.1.0), and are all case-insensitive.
      Anything else assumes bytes. <literal>1M</literal> equals one Megabyte or
      <literal>1048576</literal> bytes. <literal>1K</literal> equals one
      Kilobyte or <literal>1024</literal> bytes. These shorthand notations may
      be used in &php.ini; and in the <function>ini_set</function> function.
      Note that the numeric value is cast to <type>integer</type>;
      for instance, <literal>0.5M</literal> is interpreted as <literal>0</literal>.
     </para>
     <note>
      <title>kilobyte versus kibibyte</title>
      <para>
       The PHP notation describes one kilobyte as equalling 1024 bytes, whereas
       the <acronym>IEC</acronym> standard considers this to be a kibibyte instead.
       Summary: k and K = 1024 bytes.
