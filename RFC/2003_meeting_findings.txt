0. Prolog
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general outcome of the docmeeting was that most of our problems are
related to the overcomplicated and hard-to-maintain build system we use,
and the upcoming livedocs documentation renderer will solve most of those
problems. That will mean easier contribution, quicker and better content
distribution to sites, on-the-fly previews, better searching, etc. As a
concolusion, we have found out, that livedocs *is* the solution for most
of the problems, so the work done towards fixing problems in the current
system should be concentrated on getting livedocs be ready for our needs
as soon as possible.

1. Credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wez came up with the idea of putting author information into the refentries
and sections, which should make it quite easy to give credit. This can be
done with a <docinfo> in a <refentry>, and a <sectioninfo> for a <section>.
Both of these take on an <authorgroup> element which may contain all
necessary information. This method lets people decide on who to give credit
to on a small scale, and enables automation of extracting credit information
from XML files.
 
Start from http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/authorgroup.html to get
more information on the tag and possible parents.

For translated versions, the nicknames can be fetched from the Revision
comments, where those are appropriately specified. For the original English
text, everything not added by Hartmut [who have done file splits, movearounds]
can probably be credited to the first committer.

For the other files, people should just complain that they added it, and it
can be done by hand (they provide a link to their commit). For the language,
tutorial, and other sections it can be done by hand for now.

There are other type of contributors, who we cannot assign to individual XML
files. So there should be a separate [maybe partially generated] credits file
with their details.

Types of other contributors:
 - user note maintainers:
    andrew, meebay, didou, ... The list can be generated from the php-notes
    mailing list archive. Wez is going to do make a script pull it out from
    archives, and after that we're going to put up guidelines for who is a
    maintainer and who is not.
 - techinical editors:
    hartmut, egon, goba ... Techical editors [unless someone finds a better
    name] are those who edit the documentation and contribute to the build
    system helping the work of authors and translators.
 - authors:
    stig, philip ... Authors are for one part those who are historically
    preserved, and are not available to connect to XML files as authors.
    For another part, they are those who contribute content on a large
    scale.

It is generally quite hard to put people in a group, thus it will be decided
by group consensus. A person is not limited to be listed in only one group.
  
The author information detailed above is used to print out the author's name
on individual documentation pages in the footer with a small font. If there is
no author info section for a specific page in the XML file, then the author[s]
of the parent is shown.
 
The author info will also be used to generate a full listing of every
contributor involved in the documentation process. This list will be presented
on the bookinfo page. For translations, the translators names will show below
the authors in a separate section.

History should be preserved/maintained in all the crediting systems involved.

The idea of presenting the author of the PHP extension itself also came up,
and was generally agreed on. The documentation system can grab the list of
authors from the php-src/EXTENSIONS file, and will generate extension
specific author information by the side of the documentation authors' list.

2. Visual editing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To lower the barrier to work/in for the PHP Documentation Team, we should
provide a simple method to translate/edit files and also to add documentation.

The easiest way is to provide a simple webapp, so translators only need to
focus on the content when working on the docs. Probably bitflux editor will
be the base of this webapp. The idea is to put it to work online and see how
it can be integrated to our workflow.

The main question is how XML files will get to the editor (a checked out
phpdoc repository should be on the server behind?), and how the
edited/translated files will go back into the CVS system. We need to make
sure, that users of this system will see a unified diff, and that somehow /
somewhere a make test is run before any commit is done.

While this visual editing system will be optional, the command line based
phpdoc environment should also be simplified to help translators (ie.
remove DSSSL dependencies, tools, etc). Livedocs will help much in the
on-the-fly previewing of XML files for those too who will still edit
files with their own text editors.

 > PROGRESS: See Sandro's blog entry on some afterthoughts on such a visual
   editing system: http://www.zzoss.com/weblog/index.php?m=200307#106

3. User note handling
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people think that the approval system should go back in, but also there
should be a possibility to provide a reason when rejecting a note as to tell
the note provider why the note was rejected. If an email address of the note
provider is available, this should be mailed to him/her.

If a note maintainer doesn't know if one note is appropriate, s/he should ask
the maintainer of the extension.

Either Jim or Rasmus will add functionality to allow the general public to 
subscribe as a "maintainer" for certain note sections, as per ext/section.
In other words, allow people without cvs accounts to maintain user notes.

The user note submission interface should be extended to have an option
for users to allow the display of their email addresses or not. The mirror
distribution system should be fixed to distribute the email addresses
obfuscated, so there will be no clear email addresses in the data files.
We should also think of some solution for the problem that notes are
directly posted to the php-notes list with the email address provided,
so the archives emails are open for spammert to collect email addresses.

We have discussed the user note rating system used at gtk.php.net, and
Steph convinced us, that there is really no advantage they have gained from
it, as the average note point is around 3.0 (the default value). Also note
reordering by rating causes problems with notes reflecting to each other
(eg. "in the message above"). Therefore we are not going to put effort into
implementing this system on the PHP website.

The user notes will be bundled with some of the offline formats, so users
without always-on internet access can read the contents as well.

 > DONE: Email address obfuscation on the rsync server [Goba]

4. Buildsystem
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have discussed to replace most of the currently used tools with livedocs
to serve manual pages on mirror sites and to pregenerate manuals for download.

For the mirror sites, we would not like to add too much work on the mirror
administrators' shoulders, so we need to pregenerate the index neeeded by
livedocs on the rsync server (which needs a configured phpdoc build system)
and distribute the data with rsync (already set up for mirror sites). The
only new component we require mirror sites to set up is the PHP SQLite
extension, which is the only requirement of livedocs to be used on mirror
sites.

We will push out the preconfigured XML sources of phpdoc to the mirror sites
instead of the pregenerated PHP files of the manual, plus the index generated
on the rsync server. This index enables livedocs to locate manual parts
quickly, as well as to perform a full text search in the manual (thanks to
Ilia). This will solve our website search problem hopefully, though this
search needs to be extended to be able to search in the very few PHP files
too on the site (we should ask Ilia to do this). 404 based caching will be
employed to cache generated pages, so commonly accessed manual pages will
be pregenerated on the mirror site by livedocs. The cache will be in the
website's rsync space, so it will be emptyed on every rsync run (with
current recommended rsync setup).

For printer friendly manual pages, either a different CSS file will be added
(preferred), or if it does not fit, then the current printer friendly
URL scheme will be used to print out the pages in a different layout. To make
printing of extension documentation easier, a "one HTML page per extension"
option should be added to livedocs by Derick.
 
The XML files on the rsync server will be updated twice a day (every 12
hours), so new content will get quickly to the mirror sites. In case of there
are validity or indexing problems with the XML files, no new index will be
created, and no new XML files will be pushed out. In this case, a warning mail
will be sent to the phpdoc list, so editors can quickly fix the problem.

We also discussed adding precommit checks to validate the XML files committed,
inform the commiter of any problems, BUT not stop the commit. In coming up with
a way to prevent checking in translated versions of files in place of the
English ones, we can't really find a way of preventing that except for
tightening CVS access on a by translation base. 

The phpdoc configure system needs to be adapted to xsltproc tools, so
it should use xmllint instead of nsgmls for validity testing. This lowers
the requirements to run livedocs and in general to run a phpdoc build
system. Goba will do this.

For the pregenerated documentation, livedocs should be capable of generating
HTML files out of the manual XML files for all languages. This will be used
to generate the "multiple HTML files" version of the documentation, and will
be generated weekly for all languages.

Livedocs should also be capable of generating one big HTML file for the
documentation, as this can be used as a base for the Palm formats and the
PDF format too. If we can find a tool to convert the big HTML file leaving
links intact, we should use it to generate PDFs from the HTML file. Damien
may be able to help us, as he uses a very similar approach in his special
French version of the docs.

It is a good question, whether we need the Palm versions at all? Somebody
should check how often they are downloaded. For now, we can use the method
already implemented (generate bightml and then the Palm version out of it).

For the CHM formats, Derick will create another XSL file to generate the CHM
TOC and index file. Livedocs generated HTML files will be used in the CHMs
too.

5. Manual structure
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for referece part groupings, we have verified, that there is no solution
in the DocBook DTD to group reference parts. Livedocs is the answer for this
question, as it does not really care about the DTD, and is all written in PHP,
so modifying the code is easy.

About see also lists, the attendees of the meeting concluded in that the
current see also writing scheme is fine, and there is no need to modify
it.

The manpage based structure of the function pages were not accepted. Rasmus
convinced everybody that the manual should be consistent within itself, and
if some function is not documented the way the others are documented, then
it should be fixed. Therefore this change is only acceptable if someone
volunteers to do it in one step [so the manual won't be inconsistent].

Marcus proposed an extended proto scheme (expressed in BNF), which will
enable the documentation of OO code written in PHP extensions. We already
have a script to compare prototypes in the PHP source and in the docs
(bughunter.php), but it either needs to be extended to support the new
format, or a new program needs to be written. Marcus said he will write
a new program in C.

Goba will merge Derick's note/tip/caution/warning usage guidelines into
the HOWTO, so it will be clear for authors when to use these tags.

6. PHP 5 and PECL
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The arrival of PHP 5 really only has it's effect on the OO documentation
pages, so that sections should be split into multiple pages, and we should
add the version specific changes there. All the examples in the PHP
documentation should be 4/5 version independent, unless some version
specific feature is presented, in which case the example should clearly
state that.

While most of the extensions [if not all] will be moved to PECL, many will
still be bundled with PHP. A user would also expect to find documentation
for these at one place, as we discussed earlier, that we need to make the
PECL and PHP docs close to each other. This means that the PECL docs should
have the same format, PECL extension docs should be accessible from php.net
URL shortcuts, etc. This effectively means that PECL would have a copied
version of our build system.

To better organize resources, Rasmus suggested that we should keep all the
PECL extension docs in phpdoc, therefore there will be no need to maintain
two system, two translation teams, two rendering engines, etc. This helps
PECL look like a very much PHP-tied project, and will help extension gain 
more popularity.

If the number of PECL extensions grow significantly, first we need to have
some support for hiding the non-default extensions from the default TOC,
and from the search results. If there will be a very huge number of PECL
projects, we need to reconsider the split.

For PECL extensions, authors/credits can be read from the package.xml file,
so we can put this information into the docs automaticaly.

7. What to do with PHP 3 docs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We discussed the complete removal of the "Extending PHP 3" section, and the
complete removal of the debugging section. For the rest of the manual, every
PHP 3 specific section should be marked clearly as such.

8. Better experience
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of this part was already discussed in the build system point, and most
of the advancements can be done with livedocs (eg. syntax highlighting).

As the PECL docs will be in phpdoc, the URL shortcuts will automatically work
for PECL. We will not implement URL shortcuts on php.net for PEAR, unless the
PEAR people come up, and update, a static list of their own. (Perhaps ask
Lukas about it).

9. Seperation of PHP Manual and Internals Manual
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we already agreed on having one build system for our projects in the 6th
point, we concluded in having the internals documentation in the same XML
structure as the PHP documentation in phpdoc.

We should move all development docs into one <part> (throwing out ZendAPI cvs
on the road). The Zend API docs should be updated to contain actual
information.

Again, livedocs should be capable of presenting different "views" for
different visitors. The default view should not include the development
docs. Livedocs will use multiple caches to cache files served with
different views.

10. Licenses
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rasmus will add a new mailing list (doc-license@lists.php.net) where license
questions will be discussed. Anyone, who subscribes to this mailing list can
become part of the process, thus eliminating problems with any elections
needed to select a few responsible people.

Generally the use of documentation is only problematic, if it is done on a
large scale. If only some small part is redistributed, than it will probably
be no pain for us. If someone would like to publish a significant amount
of our work, then we will probably require him to give something back (ie.
fix errors in the docs / translation or add examples). In case of translations,
the group should ask those working on the translation too.

11. Misc notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We'll try to put a class like an ext in the docs. 
 [I am unable to understand what is this about - Goba]

Derick/Wez should fix the fopen() page to make it not look like a huge note.
