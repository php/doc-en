READ THIS FIRST

    This directory contains source files and a setup for converting
    PHP's XML documentation into presentation formats like HTML and
    RTF. You should not have to bother with this unless you are
    writing documentation yourself, or if you simply are curious
    about how the XML stuff works.

    If you just want to read the documentation, look at
    http://www.php.net/docs.php

HOW TO WRITE PHPDOC FILES

    If you are interested in information about how to
    set up the tools needed, how to work with CVS and
    DocBook on Linux or Windows, or what conventions you
    should follow when writing phpdoc files, please refer
    to the PHP Documentation HOWTO. You can find it in
    the howto directory of the phpdoc module. If you
    don't know how to produce HTML files from those XML
    files there, please download the howto.html.tar.gz
    from that directory.

    It can also be downloaded from the web easily:
    http://cvs.php.net/co.php/phpdoc/howto/howto.html.tar.gz
