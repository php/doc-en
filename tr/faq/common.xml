    <question>
     <para>
      I installed PHP, but every time I load a document, I get the 
      message 'Document Contains No Data'! What's going on here?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem
      and is core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if
      this is the case, and then try to reproduce the problem with
      a small test case. If you know how to use 'gdb', it is very
      helpful when you can provide a backtrace with your bug report
      to help the developers pinpoint the problem.  If you are using
      PHP as an Apache module try something like:
      <itemizedlist>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         Stop your httpd processes
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         gdb httpd
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         Stop your httpd processes
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         &gt; run -X -f /path/to/httpd.conf
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         Then fetch the URL causing the problem with your browser
	    </para>
 	   </listitem> 	   
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         &gt; run -X -f /path/to/httpd.conf
	    </para>
 	   </listitem> 	   
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         If you are getting a core dump, gdb should inform you of this now
	    </para>
 	   </listitem> 	   
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         type: bt
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
 	   <listitem>
	    <para>
         You should include your backtrace in your bug report. This should be submitted to 
         <ulink url="&faqurl.php.bugs;">&faqurl.php.bugs;</ulink> 
	    </para>
 	   </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
     </para>
     <para>
      If your script uses the regular expression functions
      (<function>ereg()</function> and friends), you should make sure 
      that you compiled PHP and Apache with the same regular 
      expression package. (This should happen automatically with PHP and Apache 1.3.x)

   <qandaentry id="faq.common.cgi_vars">
    <question>
     <para>
      I'm trying to access one of the standard CGI
      variables (such as $DOCUMENT_ROOT or $HTTP_REFERER) in a user-defined
      function, and it can't seem to find it. What's wrong?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
       Environment variables are now normal global variables, so you must
       either declare them as global variables in your function (by using
       "<literal>global $DOCUMENT_ROOT;</literal>", for example) or by using
       the global variable array (ie, "<literal>$GLOBALS["DOCUMENT_ROOT"]</literal>".
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.common.incompatible">
    <question>
     <para>
      I patched Apache with the FrontPage extensions patch, and suddenly PHP stopped
      working.  Is PHP incompatible with the Apache FrontPage extensions?
     </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions.
      The problem is that the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures,
      that PHP relies on.
      Recompiling PHP (using 'make clean ; make') after the FP patch is applied
      would solve the problem.
     </para>

   <qandaentry id="faq.common.bug">
    <question>
     <para>
      I think I found a bug! Who should I tell?
      </para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>
      You should go to the PHP Bug Database and make sure the bug
      isn't a known bug.  If you don't see it in the database, use
      the reporting form to report the bug.  It is important to use
      the bug database instead of just sending an email to one of the
      mailing lists because the bug will have a tracking number assigned
      and it will then be possible for you to go back later and check
      on the status of the bug.  The bug database can be found at 
      <ulink url="&faqurl.php.bugs;">&faqurl.php.bugs;</ulink>.
