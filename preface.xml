  <title>About this manual</title>
  <abstract>
   <simpara>
    <acronym>PHP</acronym>, which stands for <emphasis>PHP: Hypertext
    Preprocessor</emphasis>, is a widely-used open source general-purpose
    scripting language that is especially suited for web
    development and can be embedded into HTML. Its syntax draws
    upon C, Java, and Perl, and is easy to learn. The main goal of
    the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically
    generated web pages quickly, but you can do much more with PHP.
